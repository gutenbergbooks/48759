<h2>THE DESULTORY REMARKER.</h2>

<h3>No. IV.</h3>


<p>Spring, that delightful visiter, to
whom beauty and melody, Zephyrus
and Flora, pay their opulent but willing
tribute, has once more arrived.
Let us welcome the enchanting stranger
with joyful hearts, and let feelings
of gratitude ascend to the bountiful
source of all our enjoyments. Nature
is now</p>

<p class="center">
All beauty to the eye, and all music to the ear.<br />
</p>

<p>It is said by an eminent historian,
in his memoirs of his own life, that
the disposition to "see the favourable
rather than the unfavourable side of
things, is a turn of mind which it is
more happy to possess, than to be
born to an estate of ten thousand a
year." Such a temper is not only a
prolific source of complacency to the
individual who cherishes it, but by all
who move within the circle of its influence,
its amiable and excellent effect
is felt and acknowledged. What
a fortunate circumstance would it be
for the luckless wight, denominated
by that pure and fascinating writer
Dr. <span class="smcap">Goldsmith</span>, a <i>Magaziner</i>, as
well as for his correspondents, should
none but critics, under the influence
of this temper, undertake to adjust
their humble claims to merit. They
are frequently selected, by those who
have not even read what they undertake
to condemn, as the objects of illiberal
and unmeaning censure. The
right to criticise, is unquestionably
perfectly valid; but, like other rights,
it is liable to abuse. By accustoming
himself to indulge a querulous, fault-finding
propensity, on all occasions,
even the most distinguished orator
may descend from the high station
claimed for him by his friends, to
that of an inconsistent, petulant declaimer.
And notwithstanding the
alternate epigrammatic point of his
wit, and the brilliant coruscations of
his fancy, his speeches may at length
scarcely be heard with patience.</p>

<p>Courteous reader! if thou desirest
to make the most of human life, and
to realize its positive blessings which
are placed within thy reach, listen to
the counsels of experience, and pursue
an opposite course of conduct.
Sedulously avoid the indulgence of a
splenetic humour, consult thy own
gratification, and the happiness of
those by whom thou art surrounded,
in contemplating</p>

<p class="center">
The gayest, happiest attitude of things.<br />
</p>

<p>If thou art now scanning our present
number, with no other object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
than to detect errors and expose omissions;
if thou art pre-determined to
censure, be pleased to defer a further
examination, until thou art more disposed
to view the "<em>favourable side
of things</em>:" when this is the case, the
editors will be delighted to pay the
most respectful attention to any judicious
suggestions, promotive of improvement,
either in the plan or conduct
of this Miscellany.</p>

<p>If thou art placed in the truly responsible
situation of head of a family,
thy children and domestics, if thy deportment
convey to them the beautiful
moral lesson, afforded by a uniform
contemplation of the "<em>favourable
side of things</em>," will derive from
it the most substantial advantages.
Domestic happiness is of such an exquisite
and sensitive organization, that
it cannot endure, no not for a moment,
the scowling visage of harshness or
discord.</p>

<p>In the ordinary daily intercourse of
life, nothing conduces more to smooth
the rugged path of existence, than
urbanity and mutual indulgence. We
are so constituted, that the influence
of our conduct, whether exemplary or
otherwise, is powerful on that of those
with whom we associate. It should,
therefore, be our object to cultivate
the habit of viewing, on all occasions,
the most "<em>favourable side of things</em>."</p>

<p>Opinion is so much the child of
education, of association, and of other
adventitious causes, that it is next to
impossible to find two individuals,
whose sentiments on all subjects are
perfectly coincident. In politics, and
on a subject which is infinitely more
important, religion itself, different
sentiments as to minor points are no
doubt <em>honestly</em> entertained. Let us,
therefore, avoid impugning the motives
of those from whom we differ,
particularly where no conclusive evidence
appears as to the absence of
integrity of intention, with an eye of
charity. Let us in this instance, also,
contemplate the most "<em>favourable
side of things</em>."</p>

<p>When overtaken by adverse circumstances,
we are too prone, without
hesitation, to assume the privilege
of complaint and to infer that we are
indeed peculiarly unfortunate. But
how frequently have incidents of this
character been subsequently ascertained
to be blessings, although disguised
in the most repulsive form.&mdash;When
they occur, instead of being
overwhelmed with despondency, it is
wise to dwell on the more "<em>favourable
side of things</em>."</p>

<p>When public measures receive the
sanction of the civil government, which
are deemed destructive to the best interests
of the nation, and in utter hostility
to every principle of morality
and religion,&mdash;disheartening as the
fact may be, this consolation still remains
to the humble and sincere believer
in the superintendence of an
overruling Providence, that truth and
virtue will eventually be signally triumphant.
This cheering conviction,
where there is a consciousness of duty
faithfully performed, will gild with
radiance the most gloomy prospect.
The present is emphatically the season
of genial feelings, and nothing
imparts a livelier relish for its beauties,
than that amiable temper of mind
which on all occasions delights to
dwell on the most "<em>favourable side
of things</em>."</p>

<p class="center">FOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.</p>

<h2>THE VILLAGE TEACHER.</h2>


<p>The three great periods of life have
each their natural and appropriate
characteristic. The eager expectation,
the buoyant hope and elastic
energy, which lend their own joyous
brilliancy to every object around them,
and build in the unknown future so
fair and beautiful a fabric of happiness,
last not beyond the period of
youth. The anxious brow, the cold
and untrusting prudence, which succeed,
but too surely indicate how
many of our fairy visions have become
dim in the reality; while the steady
industry and calculating foresight with
which manhood pursues more practical
and perhaps grovelling objects,
stamp upon it a peculiar character of
strength, and seriousness, and sternness.
As this relaxes in the course
of years, our ability and inclination for
active pursuits give way; and as the
termination of our journey is approached,
the hope of future distinction
ceases, and we naturally fill up
the void which is thus left in the mind,
by a retrospect of our past actions.&mdash;Thus
it is that the seasons of life, like
those of the year, are each most beautiful
in its own proper adornings, and
that there is none more delightful or
endearing than reverend age. The
long experience which has tried the
worthlessness of so many empty and
vanishing hopes, and which can pronounce
with certainty respecting that
which remaineth; the knowledge of
those past events, that form the link
as it were between us and history, and
which not only aids us in deciphering
the past, but is endued with a prophetic
gift; the attempered zeal, the
tranquil repose of the passions, so
finely and happily compared to the
decline of day&mdash;impart their pure and
elevated feelings to the mind of the
beholder.</p>

<p>It is in such society that youth may
best learn to prune the luxuriance of
its hopes, and manhood to elevate its
views beyond the narrow scene of action
where they now expatiate. It is
in age that the noble instinct of immortality
is most conspicuous, that
we feel most surely that the horizon
of this life cannot bound our mental
vision. The consolations of youth
and manhood may have no higher
source than in surrounding objects&mdash;in
love, or friendship, or ambition;
but age is dead to these impulses, and
must be reanimated and warmed by
the influences of the life which is to
come.</p>

<p>Such an old age is that of my friend
Parmenio. He has survived nearly
all the companions of his childhood,
and seen successive generations swept
away before him. After a life of useful
and honourable enterprise, he has
retired to end his days in our little
hamlet amidst the scenes of his earliest
youth. He has dandled on his
knee the fathers of many who now
look up to him for counsel and friendship,
yet is there no supercilious air
of dignity or reserve about him. His
placid eye bespeaks the serenity of
his soul, and the hope which abideth
there; and though you see in his
sprightliness and activity the energy
of his earlier life, it is most happily
blended with the meekness and tranquillity
of age. He wears away his
remaining years in the social converse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
of his children and their friends, and
looks forward to his close without fear
or anxiety.</p>

<p>I often meet him in my solitary
evening walks, and we usually finish
them together. We were loitering
one evening on the brow of the hill
which overlooks the course of a beautiful
stream that flows at a small distance
from the village, and marking
the glories of an autumnal sunset.&mdash;"The
sands," said he, "are fast ebbing
in my glass, and I feel that my allotted
days are but few. I have past a life
of bustling activity, and seen a thousand
forms of hope and happiness rise
and vanish before me. They have all
vanished&mdash;all, but that which is centered
in heaven. I am not a votary
of that vain philosophy which would
pronounce all things to be vanity;
yet could my voice be heard by the
myriads of human beings who are
wasting the sinews of life in the pursuit
of wealth and power, I would
warn them, from my own experience,
that happiness is not in these things.
Were I to guide the course of a young
person, I would bid him extend this
view, from the first, beyond the horizon
of this world. I would tell him
of the utter emptiness of all human
distinctions. I would bid him pursue
his avocations as a means only of
health and support, and of invigorating
his mind. I would turn his feet
from the paths of fame and wealth, to
those of retirement and privacy, and
would there feed his soul with immortal
contemplations. Thus would I fit
him to ennoble his youth, to preserve
his manhood unspotted, and to enjoy
his age. How many events are there
in the course of my own life, which I
would now give the world to have
prevented&mdash;duties undone, labour
misapplied, talents wasted, feelings
perverted; and all from sharing in
the delusions to which the world
around me is a victim. In how many
events which I once thought were
accidents or misfortunes, do I now
trace an invisible hand, guiding me
against my will, and pointing to that
path of unostentatious virtue which
He delights to bless. These things,
however, cannot be recalled; and as
yonder sun, after a cold and cloudy
career, is setting at last in serene and
tranquil beauty, and throwing his own
glorious hues upon the clouds which
darkened his mid-day splendour; so
do I feel that my latter days are
peaceful, and that the lights of experience
and wisdom, though late, are
yet illuminating my past errors, and
enabling me to point them out as beacons
and waymarks to those that surround
me."</p>

<h2><i>Extract of a Letter from William
Coxe, Esq. on the Cultivation of
the Sugar Maple.</i></h2>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Burlington</span>, March 7th, 1820.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;I understand that you
have been directing your attention to
the Sugar Maple, in the belief that it
will be found an advantageous substitute
for the several varieties of poplars,
as a useful as well as ornamental
tree; and that you are desirous of
obtaining any information respecting
its culture, or properties, that I may
be able to communicate.</p>

<p>I have for some time been convinced
that none of the poplars would
prove a beneficial kind of timber to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
our farmers, from their disposition to
extend their roots, and propagate
suckers at a great distance, and from
the offensive cotton which is produced
by the Athenian and Georgia varieties&mdash;and
I have made many experiments
in the hope of discovering a
tree, valuable for its timber, and clean
and ornamental in its foliage, which
could be propagated by seedlings.
Among others, I planted the Sugar
Maple and am happy to find it one
of the hardiest and handsomest trees,
even on the light sandy soil around my
house; capable of withstanding the
severity of the drought of the last and
preceding summers, the most intense
that are recollected in our country.
Of eighteen trees I lost but two, while
the native chesnuts, raised from the
nut, all perished; and little better
success was experienced in a variety
of trees planted on the same ground,
such as the pine, sycamore, larch,
spruce, &amp;c. The American elm is
thought to be a hardy tree, but with
me it proved less so than the sugar
maple. It is generally believed that
all the varieties of the maple require
a damp soil: this is the case with several
of them, but the <i>acer saccharum</i>
flourishes in a loamy wheat soil, in
many districts of our western and
northern country. The facility by
which it may be propagated from the
seed, renders its diffusion through our
country, to any extent, very easy and
cheap.</p>

<p>Few of our native trees are more
useful for fuel, and the manufacture
of potash; and as the means of affording
a great and almost inexhaustible
supply of sugar, it becomes an object
of great importance, even to the farmer,
who is desirous of transmitting a
valuable inheritance to his children.
It is my intention to plant this tree in
the place of a line of the Athenian
poplars, which I have been obliged
to cut down after eight years luxuriant
growth, from their injurious effect
on the adjoining fields, by the extension
of their roots to sixty and
seventy feet, throwing up a little forest
of suckers.</p>

<h2><i>Treatise on Agriculture.</i></h2>

<h3>SECT. III.</h3>

<p class="center">Theory of Vegetation.</p>


<p>3d. Of <em>air</em>, and its agency in vegetation:</p>

<p>A seed deprived of air will not
germinate; and a plant placed under
an exhausted receiver, will soon perish.
Even in a close and badly
ventilated garden, vegetables indicate
their situation; they are sickly in
appearance, and vapid in taste.&mdash;These
facts sufficiently shew the general
utility of air to vegetation: but
this <em>air</em> is not now the simple and elementary
body, that the ancient chymist
described it to be. Priestly first,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and Lavoisier after him, analyzed it,
and found, that when pure, it consisted
of about 70 parts of azote, 27 of
oxygen, and 2 of carbonic acid. In
its ordinary (or impure) state, it is
loaded with foreign and light bodies;
such as mineral, animal and vegetable
vapours, the seeds of plants, and
the eggs of insects, &amp;c. Is it to this
<em>aggregate</em>, that vegetation owes the
services rendered to it by air? And
if not, to <em>how many</em>, and to <em>which</em>, of
its regular constituents, are we to ascribe
them? This inquiry will form
the subject of the present article.</p>

<p>All vegetables in a state of decomposition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
give <em>azote</em>; and some of them
(cabbages, radishes, &amp;c.) give it in
great quantity. This abundance, combined
with the fact, that vegetation is
always vigorous in the neighbourhood
of dead animal matter, led to the
opinion, that azote contributed largely
to the growth of plants: but experiments,
more exactly made and often
repeated, disprove this opinion, and
shew that in any quantity it is unnecessary,
and that in a certain proportion
it is fatal to vegetation.</p>

<p>In <em>hydrogen gas</em>, plants are found
to be variously affected, according to
their local situation; if inhabitants of
mountains, they soon perish&mdash;if of
plains, they shew a constant debility&mdash;but
if of marshy grounds, their growth
is not impeded.</p>

<p><i>Carbonic acid</i> is formed and given
out during the process of fermentation,
putrefaction, respiration, &amp;c. and
makes 28 parts out of 100 of atmospheric
air. It is composed (according
to Davy) of oxygen and carbon, in
the proportion of 34 of the former to
13 of the latter. It combines freely
with many different bodies; animals
and vegetables are almost entirely
composed of it; for the <em>coal</em> which
they give, on combustion, is but <em>carbon</em>
united to a little oxygen, &amp;c.&mdash;Priestly
was the first to discover, that
plants <em>absorbed carbonic acid</em>; and
Ingenhouse, Sennebier, and De Sausure
have proved, that <em>it</em> is their <em>principal
aliment</em>. Indeed the great consumption
made of it, cannot be explained
by any natural process, excepting
that of vegetation. On this
head, we cannot do better than digest
the experiments of these chymists into
a few distinct propositions:<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>1. In pure carbonic acid gas, seeds
will swell, but not germinate. 2.
United with water, this gas hastens
vegetation. 3. Air containing more
than one twelfth part of its volume of
carbonic acid, is most favourable to
vegetation. 4. Turf, or other carbonaceous
earth, which contains much
carbonic acid, is unfavourable to vegetation
until it has been exposed to
the action of atmospheric air, or of
lime, &amp;c. 5. If slacked lime be applied
to a plant, its growth will be impaired,
until the lime shall have recovered
the carbonic acid it lost by calcination.
6. Plants kept in an artificial
atmosphere, and charged with
carbonic acid, yield, on combustion,
more of that acid than plants of the
same kind and weight growing in atmospheric
air. 7. When plants are
exposed to air and sunshine, the carbonic
acid of the atmosphere is consumed,
and a portion of oxygen left
in its place. If new supplies of carbonic
acid be given to the air, the
same result follows; whence it has
been concluded, that air furnishes
carbonic acid to the plant, and the
plant furnishes oxygen to the air.&mdash;This
double function of absorption
and respiration, is performed by the
green leaves of plants.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> 8. Carbon
is to vegetation, what oxygen is to
animal life; it gives support by purifying
the liquids, and rendering the
solids more compact.</p>

<p>4th. Of <em>light</em>, <em>heat</em>, and <em>electricity</em>,
and their agency in vegetation:</p>

<p>When deprived of light, plants are
pale, lax and dropsical; restored to it,
they recover their colour, consistency
and odour. If a plant be placed in a
cellar, into which is admitted a small
portion of light through a window or
cranny, thither the plant directs its
growth, and even acquires an unnatural
length in its attempt to reach
it.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> These facts admitted, no one can
doubt the agency of light in vegetation;
but in relation to this agency,
various opinions exist; one, that light
enters vegetable matter, and combines
with it; another, that it makes
no part either of the vegetable or of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
its aliment, but directly influences
substances which are alimentary;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
and a third, that besides the last effect,
it stimulates the organs of plants
to the exercise of their natural functions.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Without doing more than state
these opinions, we proceed to offer
the results of many experiments on
this subject. 1st. That <em>in the dark</em>,
no oxygen is produced, nor any carbonic
acid absorbed; on the contrary,
oxygen is absorbed and carbonic acid
produced. 2d. That plants exposed
to <em>light</em>, produce oxygen gas in water.
3d. That <em>light</em> is essential to vegetable
transpiration; as this process never
takes place during the <em>night</em>, but
is copious during the <em>day</em>; and, 4th.
That plants raised <em>in the dark</em>, abound
in watery and saccharine juices&mdash;but
are deficient in woody fibre, oil, and
resins; whence it is concluded, that
saccharine compounds are formed in
the <em>night</em>, and oil, resins, &amp;c. in the
<em>day</em>.</p>

<p>When the weather is at or below
the freezing point, the sap of plants
remains suspended and hardened in
the albumum;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> but on the application
of <em>heat</em>, whether naturally or artificially
excited, this sap is rendered
fluid, is put into motion, and the buds
begin to swell. Under the same impulse,
through the medium of the
earth, the roots open their pores, receive
nutritive juices, and carry them
to the heart of the plant. The leaves,
being now developed, begin and continue
the exercise of their functions,
till winter again, in the economy of
nature, suspends the operations of the
machine. Nor is its action confined
to the circulation of vegetable juices.
Without vapour (its legitimate offspring)
the fountain and the shower
would be unknown&mdash;nor would the
great processes of animal and vegetable
fermentation and decomposition
go on. Without rain or other means
ameliorating the soil, what would be
the aspect of the globe? what the
state of vegetation? what the situation
of man?</p>

<p>The diffusion of <em>electrical</em> matter,
found in the air and in all other substances,
furnishes a presumption, that
it is an efficient agent in vegetation.
Nollet and others have thought that,
artificially employed, it favoured the
germination of seeds and the growth
of plants; and Mr. Davy "found, that
corn sprouted more rapidly in water,
<em>positively</em> electrified by the voltaic
battery, than in water <em>negatively</em> electrified."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
These opinions have not escaped
contradiction, and <em>we</em> do not profess
to decide where doctors disagree.</p>

<p>5th. Of <em>stable yard manures</em>, <em>lime</em>,
<em>marl</em>, and <em>gypsum</em>, and their agency
in vegetation:</p>

<p>We have already said, that vegetables
in the last stage of decomposition,
yield a black or brown powder,
which Mr. Davy calls "<em>a peculiar
extractive matter, of fertilizing quality</em>,"
and which the chymists of France
have denominated <em>terreau</em>. This vegetable
residuum is the simple mean
employed by nature to re-establish
that principle of fertility in the soil,
which the wants of man and other
animals are constantly drawing from
it. It was first analyzed by Hassenfratz,
who found it to contain an oily,
extractive and carbonaceous matter,
charged with hydrogen; the acetates
and benzoates of potash, lime and
ammoniac; the sulphates and muriates
of potash, and a soupy substance,
previously noticed by Bergman.&mdash;Among
other properties (and which
shows its combustible character) is
that of absorbing, from atmospheric
air, its oxygen, and leaving it only
azote. This was discovered by Ingenhouse,
who, with De Sausure and
Bracconnet, pursued the subject by
many new and interesting experiments,
the result of which is&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>1. That the oxygen thus absorbed,
deprives the terreau of part of its carbon,
which it renders soluble and converts
into mucilage; and</p>

<p>2. That the carbonic acid, formed
in the process, combines with the mucilage,
and with it is absorbed by the
roots of plants.</p>

<p>If we put a plant and a quantity of
slacked lime under the same receiver,
the plant will perish; because the
lime will take from the atmospheric
air all the carbonic acid it contains,
and thus <em>starve</em> the plant. Vegetables,
placed near heaps of lime in the
open air, suffer from the same cause
and in the same way; but though
lime, in <em>large</em> quantities, destroys vegetation,
in <em>small</em> quantities it renders
vegetation more vigorous. Its action
is of two kinds&mdash;mechanical and chymical;
the first is a mere division of
the soil by an interposition between
its parts; the second, the faculty of
rendering soluble vegetable matter,
and reducing it to the condition of
terreau.</p>

<p>The <em>mechanical</em> agency ascribed
to lime, belongs also to <em>marle</em> and to
<em>ashes</em>, and in an equal degree&mdash;but
their <em>chymical</em> operation, though similar,
is less.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><i>Gypsum</i> is composed of lime and
sulphuric acid. Mayer was the first
to present to the public a series of
experiments upon it, in its relation to
agriculture. Many chymists have
followed him, and a great variety of
opinion yet exists with regard to its
mode of operation. Yvart thinks that
the action of gypsum is exclusively
the effect of the sulphuric acid, which
enters into its composition; and founds
this opinion upon the fact, that the
ashes of turf, which contain sulphate
of iron and sulphate of alumina, have
the same action upon vegetation as
gypsum. Laysterie, observing that
plants, whose roots were nearest the
surface of the soil, were most acted
upon by plaster, concludes, that gypsum
takes from the atmosphere the
elements of vegetable life and transmits
them directly to plants. Bose
intimates, that the <em>septic</em> quality of
gypsum (which he takes for granted)
best explains its action on vegetation;
but this opinion is subverted by the
experiments of Mr. Davy, who found,
that of two parcels of minced veal,
the one mixed with gypsum, the other
left by itself, and both exposed to the
action of the sun, the <em>latter</em> was the
first to exhibit symptoms of putrefaction.
Mr. Davy's own belief on this
subject is, that it makes part of the
food of vegetables, is received into the
plant and combined with it. The last
opinion we shall offer on this head, is
that of the celebrated Chaptal. "Of
all substances, gypsum is that of
whose action we know the least. The
prodigious effect it has on the whole
race of trefoils, (clover, &amp;c.) cannot
be explained by any <em>mechanical</em> agency&mdash;the
quantity applied being so
small&mdash;or by any <em>stimulating</em> power&mdash;since
gypsum, raw or roasted, has
nearly the same effect; nor by any
<em>absorbent</em> quality, as it only acts when
applied to the leaves. If permitted to
conjecture its mode of operation, we
should say, that its effect being greatest
when applied to the <em>wet</em> leaves of
vegetables, it may have the faculty
of absorbing and giving out water and
carbonic acid, little by little, to the
growing plant. It may also be considered
as an <em>aliment in itself</em>&mdash;an
idea much supported by Mr. Davy's
experiments, which shew, that the
ashes of clover yield gypsum, though
the clover be raised on soils not naturally
containing that substance."</p>

<h2>MANURES OF GREEN CROPS.</h2>


<p>All <em>green succulent plants</em> contain
saccharine or mucilaginous matter,
with woody fibre, and readily ferment.
They cannot, therefore, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
intended for manure, be used too soon
after their death.</p>

<p>When <em>green crops</em> are to be employed
for enriching a soil, they should
be ploughed in, if it be possible, when
in flower, or at the time the flower is
beginning to appear, for it is at this
period that they contain the largest
quantity of easily soluble matter, and
that their leaves are most active in
forming nutritive matter. Green
crops, pond weeds, the paring of
hedges or ditches, or any kind of
fresh vegetable matter, requires no
preparation to fit them for manure.
The decomposition slowly proceeds
beneath the soil; the soluble matters
are gradually dissolved, and the slight
fermentation that goes on, checked by
the want of a free communication of
air, tends to render the woody fibre
soluble without occasioning the rapid
dissipation of elastic matter.</p>

<p>When old pastures are broken up,
and made arable, not only has the soil
been enriched by the death and slow
decay of the plants which have left
soluble matters in the soil; but the
leaves and roots of the grasses living
at the time, and occupying so large a
part of the surface, afford saccharine,
mucilaginous, and extractive matters,
which become immediately the food
of the crop, and the gradual decomposition
affords a supply for successive
years.</p>

<h2>ESSAY ON AGRICULTURE.</h2>


<p>The judicious and increasing attention
of our citizens to agricultural
pursuits, must be regarded, by every
enlightened friend of his country, as
among the happiest presages of its
future prosperity. Agriculture, the
most ancient and useful of the arts,
the inseparable companion, if not the
parent, of civilization, is rapidly obtaining
that rank in public estimation,
to which its intimate connexion with
the cardinal interests of every well
regulated community gives it so unquestionable
a claim. The absurd
prejudice, which has associated the
cultivation of the soil with the idea
of an ignoble servitude, is fast disappearing
under the influence of milder
systems of government, and has already
ceased to operate on minds
having the least pretensions to discrimination
or enlargement of view.&mdash;The
Patriarch of the human race
was commanded by his Creator to
"<em>replenish the earth, and to subdue
it</em>;" we may, therefore, infer, that a
limited attention to agriculture was
among the happy employments of
Adam, in the days of primeval innocence.</p>

<p>But, in the language of a distinguished
prelate, that original transgression
which banished man from
Paradise, banished Paradise from the
earth. The primal curse is still in
unmitigated operation, and, without
"<em>the sweat of the brow</em>," the least
reluctant soils will yield but scanty
fruits for the sustenance and the comfort
of man. Toil is an indispensable
pre-requisite in every department of
life, where wealth, or honour, or even
<em>daily bread</em>, is sought with a reasonable
prospect of success. The scholar,
amid the lofty abstractions of the
closet, when fatigued by incessant vigils,
realizes the painful truth, that
"<em>much study is a weariness of the
flesh</em>." The merchant, though stimulated
by the incitements of enterprise
and the bustle of occupation,
must occasionally feel the energies of
his body and mind relax under the
pressure of business, without variety
and without remission. And how
grievous are the toils of those <em>choice
spirits</em> who discover no enterprise but
in the pursuit of pleasure&mdash;who disdain
to "<em>eat the bread of carefulness</em>,"
and seek, amid the fugitive joys of
sensuality, a temporary refuge from
the torpor of dejection, or the oppressive
listlessness of voluntary inaction.</p>

<p>Let not the unobtrusive husbandman
fear to compare his lot with that
of those whose proud externals and
apparent exemption from toil are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
extremely fallacious indications of
their just rank on the scale of human
happiness. Living in a land of promise
and of plenty, and under the government
of mild equal laws, the
American Farmer must exult in the
consciousness that "<em>the lines are
fallen to him in pleasant places</em>"&mdash;that
his is, in truth, a goodly heritage.
He loves the soil, because it is the
legacy of his fathers, and because he
derives from its fruitful bosom the
means of sustaining life, and protecting
his feelings and opinions from the
dictation of arrogance and the various
temptations of penury.</p>

<p>His quiet and unsophisticated modes
of thinking and living, indispose him
to listen with eagerness to the solicitations
of intrigue or sedition, and it is
proverbial that the contagious frenzy
of revolution, extends not without difficulty,
to the cautious, reflective, and
well balanced mind of the farmer.</p>

<h2>ON DRESSING FLAX.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging"><i>Extract of a Letter from R. H.
Harrison, Esq. to J. Wood, Corresponding
Secretary of the Cayuga
Agricultural Society, N. Y.
dated</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">New York</span>, March 27, 1820.<br />
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;Every farmer is acquainted
with the method of raising
flax, and also of <em>rotting</em> it; or, as it is
generally called, water and dew <em>retting</em>,
and the method of separating
the boon, or woody matter, from the
harle, or useful fibre. Flax has deservedly
the character of being one
of the most impoverishing crops, in
the present method of treating it: it
makes no return, either as animal
food, or as manure, to the land; it is
therefore surprising that a discovery
which was to obviate all these disadvantages
should only have been
brought into practice within a few
years.</p>

<p>A Mr. James Lee, in England,
discovered that the process of steeping
and dew retting flax, or hemp, was
not necessary; and that if treated and
dressed dry, it will be superior in every
respect, produce more, and make
considerable return to the land, as
fodder for cattle and as manure.</p>

<p>A patent was granted to him in
1812; and of such importance was it
considered, that he obtained an act of
parliament to keep his specification
secret for seven years. This may be
a reason why so little has been known
of it in this country. I have, however,
one of his machines in my possession,
and have dressed flax with it.
It consists of a break, or as he called
it, a scraper, to separate the boon out
of the stem, &amp;c.&mdash;it is then passed
through a pair of finely fluted rollers,
and is finished and ready for the
hackle.</p>

<p>The flax plants, when ripe, are to
be pulled, to be spread and dried the
same as hay, laying the roots in one
direction; when dry, to be carried into
the barn: And from the report of
a committee of the house of commons
on the petition of James Lee,
and also on petition of Lee and Bundy,
respecting their new machine for
this purpose, it appears that the following
are the results of Mr. Lee's
discovery:</p>

<p>1st. That preparing flax and hemp,
in a dry state, for spinning, answered
most completely; the cost of preparing
is less, it avoids the risk of steeping,
and saves <em>time</em> and <em>material</em>.</p>

<p>2d. The <em>strength</em> and quality of
the cloth is much superior to that
from flax, water steeped or dew rotted.</p>

<p>3d. The great advantage from the
quantity of food for cattle, and also
manure obtained by this new method,
the boon, or outer coat of the flax,
containing a sixth of the gluten of
oats, the woody part being excellent
for manure.</p>

<p>It also appeared in evidence before
the committee, that</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="gain">
<tr><td align="left">100 <i>lbs.</i> flax, in a dry state, produced one fourth,</td><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="right">25</td><td align="left">lbs.</td><td align="left">fibre</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p class="noind">or a saving in proportion as 90 to 33.</p>

<p>In confirmation of this I can only
say, I procured some flax, in its dry
state, which had been thrown away as
not worth <em>retting</em>&mdash;4 lbs. of dry flax
produced 1 <i>lb.</i> of fibre fit for the
hackle: when dressed in Lee's machine,
the samples of flax, tow, and
thread, though, from the poor quality
of the flax, inferior to some samples
of English flax dressed in the
same manner, were greatly superior
to any that had been retted.</p>

<p>I have, however, never made the
experiment of weighing the flax, and
then ascertaining its produce when
retted; but from the knowledge of
those who gave evidence to this point,
have no doubt of its correctness.</p>

<p>There is another advantage; the
flax dressed in a dry state becomes
much whiter, and is easier bleached&mdash;merely
washing it in soap and water
makes it white: the finest particles
of flax are also saved, which are essential
to the manufacture of lace, or
very fine linen: the seed is also all
preserved.</p>

<p>Mr. Brande, professor of chymistry
at the Royal Institution, made some
experiments on the nutritious quality
of the chaff: the result was, an eighth
of nutritious matter. Mr. Lee says,
it is equal to a crop of oats for feeding
cattle; and it appeared also, that
horses, when accustomed to it, prefer
it to clover chaff.</p>

<p>Having thus briefly stated the advantages
of the dry method of dressing
flax, I will proceed to give some account
of the machines for preparing
it, which have been invented since
Mr. Lee's. The best appears to be
Hill and Bundy's, for which Mr.
Bundy obtained a patent, in England.
It consists of two machines, a breaker
and a rubber; the first for separating
the harle from the boon; the second
cleanses it from small particles of
wood and bark, left by the breaker.</p>

<p>The breaker consists of fine fluted
rollers, so disposed as to draw the flax
through them, at the same time to
take off the woody parts from it;
once passing through is generally
sufficient. It is a machine combining
great mechanical skill, and on an entirely
different principle from Mr.
Lee's, and is not liable to get out of
order.</p>

<p>The rubber is made to have the
same effect as rubbing by hand would,
to cleanse the fibre, and open and
subdivide it, to produce the finest
thread.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee has invented a new machine,
consisting of fluted rollers, to
work by water or horse power: it is
different from Hill and Bundy's,
which is worked by hand; and the
rollers work differently.</p>

<p>From experiments made by the
different machines, it appears by the
report of the committee of the house
of commons, that in Hill and Bundy's,
one breaker and two rubbers would
produce 80 <i>lbs.</i> of prepared flax in a
day, and would require one man or
woman and three children: the work
is light&mdash;a man can turn two breakers
and two rubbers.</p>

<p>Lee's machine would produce about
11 <i>lbs.</i> a day; his new machine,
worked by water, will product 50 <i>lbs.</i>
in a day, and requires three men or
women to attend it.</p>

<p>Having never made any of the machines,
I can only state the probable
cost. Hill and Bundy's one breaker
and two rubbers, could be furnished
for about $200. Lee's machine, at
from 60 to $70. His new machine
I have never seen a draft of, and
could not tell the cost.</p>

<p>The high cost of Hill and Bundy's
machine will prevent our farmers generally
from obtaining it. But what
better business can be done, than
purchasing the flax, in its dry state,
from the farmer, to manufacture it in
this way; and every town might employ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
its paupers in dressing flax by
these machines: they might also be
introduced into our state prisons and
penitentiaries with good effect.</p>

<p>Having given you this hasty sketch
of the recent improvement in dressing
flax, I would suggest to our agricultural
societies generally, to procure
one of the machines, as there can
be no doubt of their answering. The
general introduction of them would
not only promote greatly our agricultural
prosperity, but also the domestic
manufactures of this state.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<p><i>To dress Flax to look like Silk.</i>&mdash;Take
one part lime and between two
or three parts of wood ashes; pour
over them a due proportion of water
to make a strong ley, after they have
stood together all night, which must
be poured off when quite clear. Tie
handfuls of flax at both ends, to prevent
its entangling, but let the middle
of each be spread open, and put it in
a kettle, on the bottom of which has
been first placed a little straw, with
a cloth over it, then put another
cloth over the flax, and so continue
covering each layer of flax with a
cloth, till the kettle is nearly full.
Pour over the whole the clear ley,
and after boiling it for some hours,
take it out, and throw it in cold water:
this boiling, &amp;c. may be repeated,
if requisite. The flax must be
each time dried, hackled, beaten and
rubbed fine; and, at last, dressed
through a large comb, and through a
very fine one. By this process the
flax acquires a bright and soft thread.
The tow which is off, when papered
up and combed like cotton, is not only
used for many of the same purposes,
but makes lint for veterinary
surgeons, &amp;c.</p>

<h2>AGRICULTURAL MEMORANDA.</h2>


<p><i>Caterpillars.</i>&mdash;Hemp is a great enemy
to caterpillars. By surrounding a
bed of cabbages with a row of hemp,
the cabbages will be preserved.</p>

<p><i>Churning.</i>&mdash;After churning some
time, throw into the churn one spoonful
of distilled vinegar for every gallon
of cream. When churning proves
tedious, this will greatly hasten the
separation of the butter.</p>

<p><i>To cure Hams Westphalia fashion.</i>&mdash;Sprinkle
your ham with common
salt for one day; then wipe it dry.
Take 1 <i>lb.</i> brown sugar, <sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>4</small></sub> <i>lb.</i> saltpetre,
<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> pint bay salt, and 3 pints
common salt. Stir these well together
in an iron pan over the fire till
moderately hot. The ham to lie in
this pickle for three weeks.</p>

<p><i>Rue.</i>&mdash;The growth of this plant
ought to be cherished in every stock
yard; nothing being more salutary or
even pleasant to fowls.</p>

<p><i>Guinea Corn.</i>&mdash;The stalks of this
grain, if pressed, are said to yield a
juice sweeter and of greater body
than the sugar cane.</p>

<p><i>Carrots.</i>&mdash;According to some agricultural
reports, carrots will yield 600
or even 900 bushels per acre.</p>

<p>At the last meeting of <i>The Columbian
Institute</i>, some valuable specimens
of <i>American plants</i>, beautifully
preserved, were presented by Dr.
<i>Darlington</i>, a representative in Congress
from Pennsylvania; and several
fine specimens of <i>American minerals</i>,
chiefly collected in the valley of the
Mississippi, by Mr. <i>Schoolcraft</i>, the
ingenious author of a work which has
lately appeared on the lead mines of
Missouri, and natural history, &amp;c. of
the western country.</p>

<p><i>To make fat Lamb.</i>&mdash;"To make or
fatten lamb for the market, let your
ewes be well attended to, and fed upon
a patch of rye; upon turnips, or
other corresponding food; affording
abundant milk. As fast as your lambs
fall, and can run well alone, all you
have are to be shut up together in a
dark pen or stall, of proportionate
size to the number of lambs you expect,
having a narrow trough, breast
high to them, to be daily supplied
with Indian corn meal; with the bran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
in it; and hanging up within their
reach one or more wisps or small
bundles of fine hay for them to nibble,
at. This stall must communicate
with, or adjoin, a larger apartment,
into which you are to turn ewes twice
or thrice a day, to suckle their lambs,
and to sleep all night with them.&mdash;Before
turning the ewes out to pasture,
each time, the lambs must be
lifted into their small dark pen, or
stall, (one six or eight feet square, is
sufficiently large for thirty lambs or
more,) where they will have no room
to skip or play their fat away; here
they will nibble so much of the fine
hay, and eat so much of the dry Indian
corn meal, from want of other employment,
as to render themselves
voraciously thirsty against the next
meal of milk from their dams; which,
with the other causes mentioned,
makes them grow surprisingly large
and fat in a short time. Lambs thus
educated, will often promiscuously
suck the ewes, without knowing or
being attached to their own dams.&mdash;Hence
a very great advantage: for
when all grow large and strong, they
become capable of consuming more
milk than a single ewe can afford;
and more especially those ewes which
have two or more lambs each. For
upon killing off all the lambs of a
ewe, that ewe continues to give suck
to the other lambs promiscuously as
before, to the great advantage of the
surviving lambs, now requiring additional
nourishment. This is not the
case when lambs run out at large with
their dams."</p>

<p><i>New method of inoculating trees.</i>&mdash;A
common method of inoculating is
by making a transverse section in the
back of the stock and a perpendicular
slit below it; the bud is then pushed
down to give it the position which it
is to have. This method is not always
successful; it is better to reverse
it, by making the verticle slit above
the transverse section, and pushing
the bud upwards into its position&mdash;a
method which rarely fails of success;
because as the sap descends by the
bark, as has been ascertained, and
does not ascend, the bud thus placed
above the transverse section, receives
abundance, but when placed below,
the sap cannot reach it.</p>

<p><i>Grape Vines.</i>&mdash;About one month
since, I trimmed a very luxurious
grape vine, calculating that I was
early enough to allow the wound
made by the cutting to heal before
the sap began to rise; but to my surprise
I found, three days since, the
sap issuing from every part where the
knife had been used, the ground was
completely wet with it: I tried rosin
and other things to stop it, without
avail. In conversation with a neighbour
he informed me, that to stick a
potato on the part would stop the
sap. I tried it and found it to succeed
completely. Apprehending that many
persons may, at this season, have
vines similarly situated with mine, I
thought communicating the above
might give them an opportunity of
benefiting by the information. A. B.</p>

<p><i>To dry Peaches.</i>&mdash;The following
mode of drying peaches is adopted by
Thomas Belanjee, of Egg Harbour,
New Jersey:&mdash;He has a small house
with a stove in it, and drawers in the
sides of the house, lathed at their bottoms.
Each drawer will hold nearly
half a bushel of peaches, which should
be ripe, and not peeled, but cut in
two, and laid on the laths with their
skins downwards, so as to save the
juice. On shoving the drawer in they
are soon dried by the hot air of the
stove and laid up. Peaches thus dried
are clear from fly dirt, excellently
flavoured, and command a high price
in market. Pears thus dried eat like
raisins. With a paring machine,
which may be had for a dollar or two,
apples or pears may be pared, and a
sufficient quantity dried, to keep a family
in pies, and apple bread and
milk, till apples come again. With
a paring machine, one person can
pare for five or six cutters.</p>

<h2>CANKER ON PLUM TREES.</h2>


<p class="sig">
<i>Lansingburg, April 5, 1820.</i><br />
</p>

<p>S. <span class="smcap">Southwick</span>, Esq.</p>

<p><i>Sir</i>&mdash;I observe in your <cite>Plough Boy</cite>
of the 1st inst. some observations on
the disease in Plum Trees, called
<i>Canker</i>, wherein the writer states that
the disease is probably caused by the
trees being bark-bound. I have had
sufficient proof to convince me that
it is caused by insects only. From
a variety of observations and experiments,
I find that when young shoots
are throwing out of the trees, they are
stung by a species of fly, and a number
of eggs or nits are deposited
through the tender bark, where they
remain until the tree commences
growing the next season; those places
then begin to swell, and after a few
weeks, small worms can be distinctly
observed by the naked eye, which, after
about one month more is elapsed,
eat out of the protuberances, then become
black, take to themselves wings,
and commence operations as before
stated.</p>

<p>The only remedy that I can discover,
is to cut off every limb affected,
on its first appearance; and if the tree
be so much affected as to be past cure,
it should be totally cut down, in order
to destroy the whole race of insects
which cause the disease. The first
discovery of this complaint was on
the sea-board: and it has advanced
north about twenty miles a year. At
present nearly all the bearing trees on
the sea coast to the southeast, are totally
destroyed, and it pervades all
this part of the country. The poorest
natural blue plums are first attacked&mdash;the
dark coloured grafts,
next&mdash;and lastly, the light coloured
fruit fall victims. Some few kinds as
yet withstand their attacks. By observing
the above caution, my trees
are entirely free from them, and bear
abundantly. I am, Sir,</p>

<h2>WOODEN SOALED SHOES.</h2>


<p>Mr. Custis of Arlington, near Alexandria
in a letter to the editor dated
1st Feb. last, observes&mdash;"Wooden
soaled shoes are the very best for labourers
that I ever met with. They
keep the feet warm and dry in ditching,
and in all kinds of labour, to be
performed out of doors in winter, and
are a saving in expense of fully 80
per cent. My people are all shod in
this way, and themselves declare that
they never were so comfortable in
their feet before, while my leather
bill from $100, has been reduced to
scarce $20.</p>

<p>You form the soal, after the appearance
of the leather soal and heel,
the wood about half or three fourths
of an inch in thickness, around the
upper edge, is cut a rabbit, into
which is nailed (with ordinary sized
tacks) the upper leather.&mdash;Not a particle
of thread is needed, except to
close the two parts of upper leather.&mdash;Every
man may be his own shoemaker,
and a man would put together
a dozen pair a day. In slippery
weather, small plates of iron are nailed
around the toes and heels, and frost
nails driven in them, which also protects
tects the soal from wear. Gum, ash,
or dogwood, are best for the soals,
and about two sets will last the winter.&mdash;The
feet are never cold, or wet,
and hence will be remedied those
chronic pains and evils, to which labourers
are subject, from exposure
to cold and wet. For any purpose but
a foot race, these are the very best
shoes, and I doubt whether even Sir
Humphrey Davy has made a more
useful discovery in the last twenty
years."</p>

<p><i>Republican Manners.</i>&mdash;A gentleman,
who lately visited the Atheneum
at Boston, told us, that he saw a book
there, on the title page of which was
written these words, by the hand of
Mr. Jefferson&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"<i>From Thomas Jefferson to his friend<br />
John Adams.</i>"<br />
</p>

<p>Now, to my way of thinking, all
the flowers of rhetoric might be culled,
and yet be wanting of the "sublime
and beautiful" that irresistibly
attaches itself to this little sentence&mdash;"Thomas
Jefferson to his friend John
Adams." It affords a practical result
of our glorious system of government,
more "precious than rubies." It is
a diamond of the finest water, which
the republican should hug to his bosom
as a rich legacy to his children
and his children's children "to the
thousandth generation"&mdash;an evidence
in favour of the simplicity of the truth
never to be parted with, while the
mighty Mississippi rolls her floods to
the ocean! It is worthy of the best
days of Greek or Roman history; and
there is, doubtless, a sincerity in it
that Greece or Rome hardly knew to
exist between men so illustrious. The
time has passed away in which either
of those venerable men can be regarded
as at the head of a party in the
state, however much they were once
opposed. They are preparing "for
another and a better world;" but, like
the patriarchs of old, with joyous
hearts, survey the rich fruits of independence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
planted by their toil and
nurtured by their care. Passion has
long ceased to influence either; oblivion
has passed over their political
differences of opinion; ancient friendships
are renewed, and a spirit of harmony
and reciprocal esteem prevails
in each bosom.</p>

<p>What a magnificent sentence&mdash;"from
Thomas Jefferson to his friend
John Adams!" Let us consider how
great a space those men have filled
in the world. Each has been the rallying
point of simultaneously contending
parties&mdash;each filled the highest
office in the gift of the only free people
existing, to relieve the sombre
despotism of the civilized world.&mdash;Each
has lived to see his early vows
to the republic fulfilled; and their
present good understanding affords us
a delightful proof of the inestimable
aphorism, that "a difference of opinion
is not a difference of principle."</p>

<p>What are now John Adams and
Thomas Jefferson, so recently the
leading politicians of the day, the
heads of mighty parties?&mdash;private
citizens, wholly abstracted from the
bustle of the times, and leaning on
their good intentions, like Jacob on
his staff, to offer up thanksgivings to
the Most High for the benefits which
He has been pleased to bestow upon
their beloved country! Neither holds
a court, or is courted with sinister
views; for it is well understood that
both have retired from the influence
that might have attached itself to
them;&mdash;but the trace of their footsteps
are as blessed by a grateful people,
and a good old age has come upon
them in peace!</p>

<p>May we imitate the plainness and
sincerity of this little sentence! What
could ten thousand high-sounding titles
add to the reputation, or contribute
to the internal satisfaction of
these sages? Yet we practise them
and there are hundreds of little things
among us, creatures of the moment&mdash;here
to-day and gone to-morrow, and
forgotten, who feel insulted if they
are not called of men <em>honourable</em>,
written at full length, as if the title
made them so. I believe I never
wrote this word, as prefixed to a man's
name, but once, and think that, while
I preserve my reason and sense of
moral <em>honesty</em>, I never will write it
again, to a fellow citizen.</p>

<p>It would not do any <em>harm</em> if there
was much more of this magnificent
simplicity at the seat of government,
where comfort is often sacrificed to
form, and chilling etiquette keeps
back from those in office the very
persons that they ought to have familiar
communication with. It is the
yeomanry of the country, who are to
carry to the chiefs of the government,
the feelings and wishes of the nation:
but they are frozen by the ceremony
of their introduction to men in power&mdash;congressmen
and others. It is hateful
even to some who <em>seemingly</em> exact
it&mdash;because <em>it is "the rule."</em> Why
not abrogate the rule, and while impertinent
intrusion is kept at a distance,
receive honest worth on the
level, as man should receive man? A
little anecdote, which I have recently
heard, may illustrate this remark&mdash;a
certain gentleman, who now is a quaker,
or at least conforms to many of
their manners, a veteran of the revolution,
and one of Mr. Monroe's earliest
friends, having business at Washington,
was specially sent for by the
president, who had not seen him for
more than forty years. The old man
went to the president's house; he was
met in the hall by the servants, who
separately asked him for his cane, his
coat, and his hat. The latter he
would not part with, and it was intimated
to him that he could not go into
the president's room unless he dispossessed
himself of it; but he observed,
'if he couldn't go in, he could
go out,' and began to prepare for his
departure. Then it was said, he might
go in with his hat on, if he was willing
in risk it! He was willing, and entered,
and was received by the president
as a true friend ought to be received;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and they had a very interesting interview,
grateful to one another. How
much pleasure was nearly denied to
Mr. Monroe for a matter of form!&mdash;for,
if the sturdy old republican had
once left the house, they never could
have prevailed upon him to enter it
again!</p>

<p>All <em>mere</em> ceremonies are easy, and
even in matters of the highest import,
become mechanical to those accustomed
to perform them daily&mdash;but
are always irksome to those who never
went through them&mdash;nor do they
form any part of our habits of thinking
and acting, as conformable to the
nature of our institutions. I am apprehensive
that they are on the increase,
though well convinced that
they are not desired by the president
himself, and others that I could name.
But they are <em>fashionable</em>; and it is
easier to correct a positive vice than
to do away an idle fashion. This
fashion keeps no one from the presence
of influential persons who has
sinister designs to accomplish, but
checks the warm flow of the blood
with which an honest farmer or mechanic
would meet his own elected
rulers, and prevents that freedom of
discussion by which truth is manifested.
Let us all endeavour to imitate
the simplicity and frankness of
Jefferson&mdash;under this solemn assurance,
that the further we are removed
from this plainness, the greater is
the danger of despotism. I am very
far from being an enemy to what are
called the elegancies of life, and am
quite willing that, if a couple of dancing
masters meet, they should bow
to each other, "according to rule,"
for half an hour before they approached
near enough to touch the tip of
each other's finger, as the <em>sign</em> of
shaking hands! Let those enjoy it
who can, and practice it who may&mdash;but
it is not the <em>manner</em> in which sincerity
is shown, or good fellowship
promoted. The homage of the heart,
such as the republican will feel in
reading the <em>text</em> of this article, is
worth more than all the forms of etiquette
ever devised. It is as a rock in
the midst of the sea&mdash;faction assails it
in vain; it is <em>principle</em> only that takes
effect upon it. The tide of popularity
may rise and fall, but the foundation is
not to be shaken.</p>

<h2><i>On the Importance of Manner.</i></h2>


<p>To exasperate is not the way to
convince: nor does asperity of language
or of manner necessarily belong
to the duty of plain dealing. So
far otherwise, a scolding preacher, or
a snarling reprover, betrays alike a
gross ignorance of the philosophy
of the human mind, and the absence
of Christian meekness; and how
zealous soever be his aim to do good,
the provokingness of his manner will
defeat the benevolence of his intentions.</p>

<p>The following remarks are from
the pen of a man as distinguished for
Christian piety as for superiour genius&mdash;the
immortal Cowper. "No
man" (says that <em>evangelical</em> poet)
"was ever scolded out of his sins. The
heart, corrupt as it is, and because it
is so, grows angry if it be not treated
with some management and good
manners, and scolds again. A surly
mastiff will bear perhaps to be stroked,
though he will growl under that
operation, but if you touch him
roughly, he will bite. There is no
grace that the spirit of self can counterfeit
with more success than that of
zeal. A man thinks he is fighting for
Christ, when he is fighting for his
own notions. He thinks that he
is skillfully searching the hearts of
others, when he is only gratifying the
malignity of his own, and charitably
supposes his hearers destitute of all
grace, that he may shine the more in
his own eyes by comparison."</p>

<p>Nor is scolding, or ridicule either,
the proper way to cure men of their
religious prejudices: for, by inflaming
their anger, it renders their prejudices
the more stubborn and inveterate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
It is no matter how absurd
or even how monstrous their errors
and prejudices; if you offend them
by the grossness of your manner,
there is little hope of your convincing
them afterwards by the cogency of
your reasoning.</p>

<p>The Baptist Missionaries in India,
at the first insulted, as we are told,
the superstition which they attacked,
and ridiculed and reviled the Bramins
in the streets, and at their festivals,
when the passions of the blinded and
besotted populace were most likely to
be influenced. But experience taught
those pious and apostolical men, that
this was not the right way to make
converts: for which reason, in 1805,
they made a declaration of the great
principles upon which they thought
it their duty to act. "It is necessary,"
say they, "in our intercourse with
the Hindoos, that, as far as we are
able, we abstain from those things
which would increase their prejudices
against the gospel. Those parts
of English manners which are most
offensive to them should be kept out
of sight; nor is it advisable at once
to attack their prejudices, by exhibiting
with acrimony, the sins of their
gods; neither should we do violence
to their images, nor interrupt their
worship."</p>

<p>Now if this forbearance from every
thing provoking, whether in language
or manner, was expedient in
dealing with the errors of the grossly
idolatrous pagans, it is assuredly
not less expedient for fellow Christians,
in their treatment of the real
or supposed religious errors of one
another. Bitter revilings and contumelious
denouncements always provoke,
but never convince. If they
are used instead of argument, they
betray a conscious weakness; for it
is much easier to revile and denounce
than to argue. And furthermore, we
are quite as apt to be furiously in
the wrong, as to be furiously in the
right: or even if we know ourselves
to be right as to matter, we put ourselves
in the wrong as to manner, if
we make use of foul weapons rather
than those which the armoury of
reason supplies.</p>

<p><i>Manner</i> is to be carefully studied
by every one, whether in a public or
a private station, who undertakes to
reclaim the vicious, or to convince
the erring: for what would be beneficial
if done in one manner, would
be worse than labour lost, if done in
another. A haughty, supercilious
manner never wins, seldom convinces,
and always disgusts; whereas that
which indicates meekness and unmingled
benevolence and compassion,
rarely fails of some salutary impression;
especially if suavity of manner
be accompanied with force of reasoning,
and a due regard be had to time,
place, and circumstances.</p>

<p>No very long while ago, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;,
an American clergyman, as distinguished
for pious zeal as for eminent
parts, was passing a river in a ferry
boat, along with company of some distinction,
among which was a military
officer who repeatedly made use of
profane language: Mr. &mdash;&mdash; continued
silent till they had landed, when
taking him aside, he expostulated
with him in such a moving manner,
that the officer expressed his thanks,
and his deep sorrow for the offence;
but added withal: "<i>Sir, if you had
reproved me before the company, I
should have drawn my sword upon
you.</i>"</p>

<p>There are some who glory in it,
that by their plain dealing they wound
the pride of those they deal with.
Peradventure with greater pride they
do it. Often, we are so little aware
of the obliquities of our own hearts,
that we may be feeding and nourishing
pride within ourselves whilst we
are zealously aiming our blows at the
pride of others. Our love of chiding,
our coarse bluntness, which we
fondly term an honest plain heartedness,
or a warmth of zeal, may possibly
spring from other motives than
those of pure Christian benevolence.</p>

<h2>EXTRACT FROM WILKINSON'S MEMOIRS.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Sentiments of an Old Soldier.</i></p>


<p>Let those parents who are now
training their children for the military
profession, let those misguided patriots,
who are inculcating principles of
education subversive of the foundations
of the republic, look at this picture
of distress, taken from the life
of a youth in a strange land, far removed
from friends and relations, comingled
with the dying and the dead,
himself wounded, helpless, and expiring
with agony, and then should political
considerations fail of effect, I
hope the feelings of affection, and the
obligations of humanity, may induce
them to discountenance the pursuits of
war, and save their offspring from the
seductions of the plume and the sword,
for the more solid and useful avocations
of civil life; by which alone peace
and virtue, and the republic, can be
preserved and perpetuated. A dupe
during my whole life, to the prejudices
I now reprobate, I speak from experience,
and discharge a conscientious
duty, when I warn my country against
military enthusiasm, and the pride of
arms; and against the arts and intrigues
by which the yeomanry, the
palladium of the republic, are depreciated,
and standing armies and navies
are encouraged. For what would it
avail the citizens of the United States,
if in a political frenzy, they should
barter their rights and liberties for
national renown? And who would
exchange the blessings of freedom,
for the repute of having eclipsed the
whole human race in feats of valour
and deeds of arms? This is a serious
question! It affects the vital interests
of every freeman; and the course of
the government makes it proper and
necessary, that these states should
pause and reflect, before it be too
late. We have escaped from one war
with a crippled constitution; the next
will probably destroy it; therefore
let the motto of the state be&mdash;PEACE.</p>

<h2>DR. FRANKLIN.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging"><i>Extracts from a letter of Mr. Jefferson,
dated December 4th, 1818,
respecting Dr. Franklin.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>"Dr. Franklin had many political
enemies, as every character must,
which, with decision enough to have
opinions, has energy and talent to give
them effect on the feelings of the adversary
opinion. These enmities were
chiefly in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.
In the former they were
merely of the proprietary party: in
the latter they did not commence till
the revolution, and then sprung chiefly
from personal animosities, which
spreading by little and little, became
at length of some extent. Dr. &mdash;&mdash;
was his principal calumniator; a man
of much malignity, who, besides enlisting
his whole family in the same
hostility, was enabled, as the agent of
Massachusetts with the British government,
to infuse it into that state
with considerable effect. Mr. Jay,
Silas Deane, Mr. Laurens, his colleagues
also, ever maintained towards
him unlimited confidence and respect.
That he would have waived
the formal recognition of our independence,
I never heard on any authority
worthy notice. As to the
fisheries, England was urgent to retain
them exclusively, France neutral,
and I believe that had they been
ultimately made a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</i>, our
commissioners (Mr. Adams excepted)
would have relinquished them rather
than have broken off the treaty.
To Mr. Adams' perseverance alone
on that point, I have always understood
we were indebted for their reservation.
As to the charge of subservience
to France, besides the evidence
of his friendly colleagues before
named, two years of my own service
with him at Paris, daily visits, and the
most friendly and confidential conversations,
convince me it had not a shadow
of foundation. He possessed the
confidence of that government in the
highest degree, insomuch that it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
truly be said that they were more under
his influence, than he under theirs.
The fact is, that his temper was so
amiable and conciliatory, his conduct
so rational, never urging impossibilities,
or even things unreasonably inconvenient
to them; in short, so moderate
and attentive to their difficulties,
as well as our own, that what his
enemies called subserviency, I saw
was only that reasonable disposition,
which, sensible that advantages are
not all to be on one side, yielding what
is just and liberal, is the more certain
of obtaining liberality and justice.&mdash;Mutual
confidence produces of course
mutual influence, and this was all
which subsisted between Dr. Franklin
and the government of France.</p>

<p>"I subjoin a few anecdotes of Dr.
Franklin, within my own knowledge.</p>

<p>"Our revolutionary process, as is
well known, commenced by petitions,
memorials, remonstrances, &amp;c. from
the old Congress. These were followed
by a non-importation agreement,
as a pacific instrument of coercion.
While that was before us,
and sundry exceptions, as of arms,
ammunition &amp;c. were moved from
different quarters of the house, I was
sitting by Dr. Franklin, and observed
to him that I thought we should except
books: that we ought not to exclude
science, even coming from an
enemy. He thought so too, and I
proposed the exception, which was
agreed to. Soon after it occurred
that medicine should be excepted,
and I suggested that also to the doctor.
'As to that,' said he, 'I will
tell you a story. When I was in London,
in such a year, there was a weekly
club of physicians, of which Sir John
Pringle was president, and I was invited
by my friend Dr. Fothergill, to
attend when convenient. Their rule
was to propose a thesis one week,
and discuss it the next. I happened
there when the question to be considered
was, Whether physicians had
on the whole, done most good or
harm? The young members, particularly,
having discussed it very learnedly
and eloquently till the subject
was exhausted, one of them observed
to Sir John Pringle, that, although it
was not usual for the president to take
part in a debate, yet they were desirous
to know his opinion on the question.
He said, they must first tell
him whether, under the appellation
of physicians, they meant to include
<em>old women</em>; if they did, he thought
they had done more good than harm;
otherwise more harm than good.'</p>

<p>"The Confederation of the States,
while on the carpet before the old
Congress, was strenuously opposed
by the smaller States, under the apprehension
that they would be swallowed
up by the larger ones. We
were long engaged in the discussion;
it produced great heats, much ill humour,
and intemperate declarations
from some members. Dr. Franklin
at length brought the debate to a
close with one of his little apologues.
He observed, that 'at the time of the
union of England and Scotland, the
Duke of Argyle was most violently
opposed to that measure, and among
other things predicted that, as the
whale had swallowed Jonas, so Scotland
would be swallowed by England.
However,' said the doctor, 'when
Lord Bute came into the government,
he soon brought into its administration
so many of his countrymen, that
it was found, in the event, that Jonas
swallowed the whale.' This little story
produced a general laugh, restored
good humour, and the article of difficulty
was passed.</p>

<p>"When Dr. Franklin went to
France on his revolutionary mission,
his eminence as a philosopher, his
venerable appearance, and the cause
on which he was sent, rendered him
extremely popular; for all ranks and
conditions of men there, entered
warmly into the American interest.
He was therefore feasted and invited
to all the court parties. At these he
sometimes met the old Duchess of
Bourbon, who being a chess-player of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
about his force, they very generally
played together. Happening once to
put her king into <em>prise</em>, the Doctor
took it. 'Ah,' says she, 'we do not
take kings so.' 'We do in America,'
said the doctor.</p>

<p>"At one of these parties, the Emperor
Joseph II., then at Paris, <i>incog.</i>
under the title of Count Falkenstein,
was overlooking the game, in silence,
while the company was engaged in
animated conversations on the American
question. 'How happens it,
M. Le Comte,' said the Duchess
'that while we all feel so much interest
in the cause of the Americans,
you say nothing for them?' 'I am a
king by trade,' said he.</p>

<p>"When the Declaration of Independence
was under the consideration
of Congress, there were two or three
unlucky expressions in it, which gave
offence to some members. The words
'Scotch and other auxiliaries,' excited
the ire of a gentleman or two of
that country. Severe strictures on
the conduct of the British king, in negativing
our repeated repeals of the
law which permitted the importation
of slaves, were disapproved by some
southern gentlemen, whose reflections
were not yet matured to the full abhorrence
of that traffic. Although
the offensive expressions were immediately
yielded, these gentlemen continued
their depredations on other
parts of the instrument. I was sitting
by Dr. Franklin, who perceived that
I was not insensible to those mutilations.
'I have made it a rule,' said
he, 'whenever in my power, to avoid
becoming the draughtsman of papers
to be reviewed by a public body. I
took my lesson from an incident which
I will relate to you. When I was a
journeyman printer, one of my companions,
an apprentice hatter, having
served out his time, was about to open
shop for himself. His first concern
was to have a handsome sign-board,
with a proper inscription. He composed
it in these words:&mdash;'John
Thompson, <i>Hatter</i>, <i>makes</i> and <i>sells</i>
<i>hats for ready money</i>,' with a figure
of a hat subjoined. But he thought
he would submit it to his friends for
their amendments. The first he
showed it to, thought the word '<em>hatter</em>'
tautologous, because followed by the
words 'makes hats,' which shew he
was a hatter. It was struck out. The
next observed that the word '<em>makes</em>'
might as well be omitted, because his
customers would not care who made
the hats; if good and to their mind,
they would buy, by whomsoever
made. He struck it out. A third
said, he thought the words '<em>for ready
money</em>,' were useless, as it was not the
custom of the place to sell on credit:
every one who purchased expected to
pay. They were parted with, and the
inscription now stood, 'John Thompson
sells hats.' '<em>Sells</em> hats?' says his
next friend; 'why nobody will expect
you to give them away. What then
is the use of that word?' It was stricken
out, and '<em>hats</em>' followed it, the rather,
as there was one painted on the board;
so his inscription was reduced ultimately
to 'John Thompson,' with the
figure of a hat subjoined.'</p>

<p>"The Doctor told me, at Paris, the
following anecdote of the Abbé Raynal.&mdash;He
had a party to dine with
him one day, at Passy, of whom one
half were Americans, the other half
French; among the last was the Abbé.
During the dinner he got on his favourite
theory of the degeneracy of
animals, and even of man, in America,
and urged it with his usual eloquence.
The Doctor at length noticing
the accidental stature and position
of his guests, at table, 'Come,'
said he, 'M. l'Abbé, let us try this
question by the fact before us. We
are here one half Americans, and one
half French; and it happens that the
Americans have placed themselves
on one side of the table, and our
French friends are on the other. Let
both parties rise, and we will see on
which side nature has degenerated.'
It happened that his American guests
were Carmichael, Harmer, Humphreys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
and others of the finest stature
and form; while those of the other
side were remarkably diminutive, and
the Abbé himself, particularly, was a
mere shrimp. He parried the appeal
however, by a complimentary admission
of exceptions, among which the
Doctor himself was a conspicuous
one."</p>

<p><i>Whimsical conflict.</i>&mdash;It would be
well for society, if all duellists were
to find themselves in the same predicament
as did the celebrated poet,
Dr. Akenside, and a gentleman of the
bar by the name of Ballow. A challenge
had passed from the former&mdash;but
they did not get into the field;
for one would not consent to fight in
the morning, and the other was equally
determined not to do so in the evening!
The one wished to fall in a blaze
of glory, mingled with the brilliant
rays of the rising sun, a very fanciful
and poetic notion; and the other, with
perhaps an equal degree of poetic
feeling and imagination, thought the
shades of eve more congenial with
the work of death and the hour of dissolution.
Whether serious or affected,
the difference was perhaps a happy
one for the lovers of literature,
who might otherwise have lost the
keen and inexpressible delight which
ever flows from the perusal of Akenside's
Pleasures of Imagination&mdash;a
work which will charm and instruct
mankind through every age, so long
as learning, taste, and genius, shall
have a votary or a favourite to relish
so rich a banquet. The hand of blood,
that had deprived the republic of letters
of that incomparable poem, would
have well deserved everlasting execration.</p>

<h2>LAW-SUIT.</h2>


<p>The longest law-suit ever heard of
in England, or perhaps in the world,
was between the heirs of Sir T. Talbot;
Viscount Lisle, on the one part,
and the heirs of Lord Berkeley on
the other, respecting certain possessions
not far from Wotton-under-Edge,
in the county of Gloucester.
The suit was commenced at the end
of Edward IV. and was depending
till the reign of James I. when a
compromise took place, it having
lasted above a hundred and twenty

<h2>THE CAMERONIANS.</h2>

<p class="center">From Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, Nov. 1819.</p>


<p>For the Cameronians, those relicks
of the stern enthusiastic Covenanters&mdash;those
resolute maintainers of the
unblemished purity and rights of the
reformed church&mdash;those dwellers on
the misty mountain tops&mdash;I entertain
the greatest respect and reverence.
It was my lot to pass the early part
of my life in the neighbourhood of
their hill of worship&mdash;often in the company
of their leading men, and most
admired professors&mdash;and at all times
in the society of a portion of their number.
They had hovered for many
years about the mountainous regions
of the parish of Kirkmahoe, in Dumfries-shire;
and as they began to confide
in the kindness of their less rigid
brethren, they commenced descending,
step by step, from a large hill to
a less, till they finally <em>swarmed</em> on a
small sterile mount, with a broomy
glen at its foot, beside a little village,
which one of their number named
"Graceless Quarrelwood." Quarrelwood
is a long straggling village, built
in open hostility to regular lines, or
the graceful curves of imaginary
beauty. The cottages which compose
it are scattered as if some wizard
had dropt them down by random;
and through the whole a streamlet
winds, and a kind of road infinitely
more crooked than the stream. This
lane is fringed chiefly by old plum-trees,
and seeks its way to the eastern
extremity of the village, with a difficulty
which a stranger will soon be
sensible of, should he be so hardy as
to endeavour to thread this Cameronian
labyrinth. There is also a wide
wilderness of gardens, hemmed in by
strong walls of rough free-stone. It
is a very defensible position; and, in
case of retreat, the deep channels of
two scanty streams present direct
openings to the upland holds; and
these are covered ways&mdash;for the
brooks contrive to maintain as many
stately trees and flourishing bushes on
their steep and impassable banks, as
would do honour to mightier streams.
To this rural encampment several
hundreds resorted weekly to hear
their pastor's instructions; and at
their great midsummer Festival of
the Sacrament, several thousands
usually assembled, many of them from
distant parts, even from Fife and
Banff. All around were objects to
cherish their ancient spirit, and remind
them of other days. The seat
of their bitter persecutor, General
Dalzell, was within two short miles&mdash;the
grave of the cruel Laird of
Lagg was visible from their mount;
and in the church-yard of Dumfries,
in the moors of Irongray, and the
moorlands of Nithsdale, were buried,
under broad and inscribed stones,
some of the most renowned of the
martyrs. With two of their preachers
I had the pleasure of being acquainted;
and I have also heard several
of the western professors preach
during the continuance of the sacramental
holydays. Of their professors
I shall endeavour to render some account.
I still remember, with reverence,
the thin long snowy hair and
bald shining crown, and primitive
look of the patriarchal Farely; and it
is impossible I should ever forget the
familiar and fervent eloquence of that
delightful old pastor. Towards the
close of his life, which was unusually
long, he was accused of cheering his
decaying spirits with other beverage
than what cold brooks afforded. Of
this infirmity I have heard some of
the sternest of his flock speak with
unlooked-for gentleness; and I believe
none of his fellow-preachers
chose to rebuke him for this indulgence,
from a just dread of his powers
for keen dry sarcasm. He was a great
favourite with the Cameronian ladies,
old and young, and his reputation with
them was not at all diminished, by the
renown he acquired by his ability in
inflicting the discipline of his sect on
fair trespassers.</p>

<p>Of John Curtis, the regular pastor
of the flock, I do not remember so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
much as I do of Mr. Farely. He was
a man unaffectedly pious, rather than
eloquent, and was deservedly and
warmly beloved. He adorned his
discourses with that melodious tone
which some call the Cameronian
drawl, and which the pious Cowper
complained of in the Conventicles.
Each sentence has a kind of starting
note; and I can discover remains of
this old puritanical fashion in the eloquence
of Wilberforce and also Lord
Milton. It would require some constraint
in a pious stranger to listen,
without an inward smile at least, to
this continually recurring chorus.&mdash;With
a gifted preacher it is less ungraceful,
for he contrives to make it
tell in better time than an ordinary
man&mdash;still it might be spared; but a
very sensible divine told me, he dared
as soon renounce predestination as
part with the "twang;" it was as
dear to his flock as the memory of
Richard Cameron. John Curtis, for
he abominated the prelatical designation
of "Master," was not an unfrequent,
or unwelcome guest at my father's
house. His coming was a visitation,
for it came over our mirth as
a cloud. He invariably was invited
on week days; Sunday was a day that
had higher duties. His coming was
the signal for seven children, I was
one of them, to cease their play and
pranks, and mix trembling with their
mirth. We became as quiet as a
brood of chickens, over which the
hawk is hovering. Even the nuts or
raisins which filled the pockets of this
primitive person, and which he divided
among us with many a clap on the
head and benediction, failed to inspire
confidence.</p>

<p>The chief revolution in the affairs
of the Cameronians of Dumfriesshire,
was effected at the death of
John Curtis. They had been driven
by persecution to preach on the
mountains, and though persecution
had ceased, on the mountains they
remained. It was certainly a beautiful
and impressive sight to see a
congregation worshipping God on a
mountain side or a wild glen; to see
the upright pulpit-rows of bared, and
white, and bald heads decently ranged
around&mdash;and more extended ranks of
beautiful women and active men
drawn up in a regular confusion&mdash;the
whole listening to the eloquence
of my old friend Farely. This, with
a clear day and a bright sun, must
make an impression of devotion on
the most obtuse intellect. But as the
mason said of the wise man who sung,
"Snow is beautiful in its season,"
"My certes," said he, "it was easy
for him, with his lasses and his wine
to sing so; had he been a poor free-stone
mason, he would have sung another
sang." For the weather seemed
sometimes to inherit the rancour of
the bloody Claverhouse, or the renowned
chieftain of Lagg, to this
persecuted race; and, instead of June
giving one of her brightest and balmmiest
days for the Sacrament, I have
witnessed the heavy rain come down
sans intermission for four stricken
hours, as if ambitious to measure its
mercies by the length of the "Action
Sermon." By some this circumstance
was hailed as a divine acknowledgment
of their presence and influence;
and after some very dry weather I
have heard Mr. Farely turn a timely
thunder shower to good account, by
apostrophizing the Deity for his kindness
to "this dry barren land." On
another occasion&mdash;the morning was
serene during the introductory discourse,
and just as my friend Farely
began to administer the sacrament, a
huge black cloud sailed from the
westward, and hung heavy and ominous
over the congregation. Ere the
ladies could raise their plaids, it descended
perpendicular plump down,
and the huge drops splashed off the
bald crown of the preacher, in a manner
that Kemble would have envied
in acting King Lear. A Cameronian
with an umbrella, at that time an unusual
thing in the country, arose and
stretched it over the Professor's head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
regardless of himself. At this visible
interposition between him and heaven,
the preacher was wroth, and said
audibly, "Take the Pope's cap off
me," and his conduct was highly applauded.</p>

<p>To such a congregation, after the
decease of John Curtis, my friend of
the umbrella made a proposition to
have a chapel erected. And I question
much if a proposal to go to mass
would have excited a stronger commotion&mdash;particularly
among those
whom the measure meant to protect&mdash;the
old and infirm. He of the umbrella
offered to subscribe largely
himself, and promote the subscription
among others, hinting that many of
the members of the kirk favoured
the cause, and would be glad of an
opportunity to display it. The motion
was well timed too, namely, at
the close of one of those four-hours
benedictions from a thunder cloud,
which had urged its way through the
broad bonnets and thick plaids of the
most obstinate believers. I cannot
enumerate to you all the bitter and
brief exclamations of dismay and indignation
which this proposal excited.
The decided wrath of one old moorland
dame I shall long remember,
"Foul fall ye," said she, starting up
and hurling her heavy clasped black
print Bible at the proposer's head,
"foul fall ye, ye deserve to be brained
with the word ye hae abused;"
and had he of the umbrella not caught
this religious missile, as the Curtal
fryar's dogs caught the outlaw's arrows,
namely, as it flew, he might
have been numbered with the martyrs.
"Shall <em>we</em>," said she, "who
were hounded like deer to the mountains,
there to worship God in fear of
evil men, shall <em>we</em>, whom he marvellously
protected there, doubt his providence,
and descend to keep yer
coupled timber&mdash;yer covered cushions&mdash;and
yer canopied, fringed, and
painted prelatical pulpits&mdash;and yer
walls of hewn stane&mdash;far frae me&mdash;fit
places are they, not for the word, but
for ye ken what;"&mdash;and so she sat
down. The more sensible part reflecting,
however, that the showers of
spring were cold&mdash;that the winds of
autumn were not always gentle&mdash;and
that winter indulged them with various
and dubious blessings, under the
resemblance of snows and sleets, and
sudden thaws, resolved, that the erection
of a house of worship was a justifiable
measure; and a house was accordingly
built. But the eloquent
dame of the moorlands introduced a
salvo, by which the sacrament was
directed to be administered in the
open air, and so it still continues.</p>

<p>The religious festival of the sacrament
is commenced after due private
preparation by prayers of unwonted
length, and the lonely broomy hollow
where it is held, exhibits on Sabbath
morn to a stranger a grand and solemn
spectacle.</p>

<p>The last time I was present at this
meeting I was invited to breakfast at
the house of a respectable and recently
converted member of the "Broken
Remnant," a warm-hearted weaver, a
man of rare conversation&mdash;ready wit,
and cutting dry sarcasm. He was also
as much celebrated for his poetry as
the unrivalled productions of his loom.
His birds-eye, his barley-pickle, his
lowland plaiden, and fine linen, were
the theme of praise among the young
maids in danger of being married&mdash;and
to their praise I add mine. I
have proved his hospitality, and proved
the labours of his loom. I sat
down to an ample breakfast with this
Cameronian worthy&mdash;his wife lively
always, and once handsome&mdash;his two
sons, inheriting their father's powers
even to overflowing, and a solemn
browed Cameronian from the borders
of the moorlands. This family auxiliary
undertook to pronounce a blessing
on our good cheer; a serious
trial of my patience and appetite. I
endured his sermon for many minutes;
it was in its nature controversial. He
touched on the adventure at Drumclog,
and addressed Providence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
strong and familiar term anent the
disaster at Bothwell Brig. I looked
piteous but resigned, and the good
housewife poured forth the tea. But
then there came headings and hangings,
and finings and confinings, and
sad travels and sore tortures. The
goodwife placed a plate of smoking
savoury cake before him, but he was
not to be tempted; he threw a passing
curse or two on patronage, still
he was distant from our day half a
century at least. I looked with an
imploring eye, and my entertainer
closed his; but I could see by the
sarcastic curl at the corners of his
mouth that he was inwardly enjoying
my misery. Once I stretched my
hand, for I had half a mind, like the
renowned and impatient good man of
Drumbreg, on a time of similar trial,
to seize my cup with a cry of "Ye
have done brawly man," and cut short
all explanation by falling to. I endured
it to an end however, and an
excellent breakfast enabled me to
endure the infliction of a "return
thanks," eminently curious and controversial.
We then sallied forth to
the preaching&mdash;the pastor had already
commenced; it might be half past 9
o'clock. I was struck with the magnitude
and repose of the congregation.
Besides the sodded seats which held
the oldest and most respectable members,
the broom then, I think, in full
bloom, with all its perfume about it,
was bent down for many acres to form
rural seats to Cameronian dames, and
dames indeed of all persuasions.&mdash;There
were many dressed in the latest
fashion; the old simple mode of dress
however prevailed. Though all shewed
deep symptoms of devotion, and
many of awe, the young women by no
means confined their eyes, and many
had bright ones, to the contemplation
of the preacher. This festival always
attracts an immense multitude, and
though the Cameronians are the only
communicants, all sects and denominations
of Presbyterians crowd to the
place, and occupy the vacant ground.
I saw many of the Cameronians with
whom I had a personal acquaintance,
and a silent squeeze of the hand, or
an acknowledgment, an austere one,
of the eye, was all the recognition to
be obtained. The list of offences and
sects excluded from communication
is extensive and curious&mdash;they call it
"debarring"&mdash;Socinians, Arminians,
Unitarians, Episcopalians, false teachers,
promiscuous dancers, and playhouse
frequenters. I cannot inflict
the whole of this tremendous catalogue
upon you. One prudent and
warning exclusion I cannot omit to
mention, namely, that of all wives
who disobey their husbands.</p>

<p>In the green hedge-row lane, leading
to the tent of the preacher, various
stalls were established by persons
who thought&mdash;as godliness was great
gain, great gain was godliness. Here
refreshments of all kinds, particularly
liquid consolation, abounded, and one
tent, rivalling in dimensions the tabernacle
of the preacher, looked presumptuously
down from the very crest
of the hill on its more devout neighbour
below. Here the owner of a
neighbouring public house had established
himself, and into this canvass
mansion, in a moment of weakness, I
was tempted to enter. I had sundry
reasons for this piece of backsliding;&mdash;first,
I had become wearied with the
unexampled length and tediousness of
the before-mentioned four hour's sermon;
secondly, I was desirous to partake
of either Ram-Jam, Mid-Row, or
Pinkie, three denominations of ale,
for which the landlord was become
deservedly famous, and in the brewing
of which, weak nerves, as well as a
good head, had been doubtlessly consulted&mdash;and;
thirdly and lastly, a
dark-eyed damsel from the mountains
wished for my private opinion
anent the sinfulness of dancing, and
to instruct me in a near road over the
hills to her father's house, which
stood in a remote glen on the stream
of Ae. While deeply employed in
taking a chart of this desart path, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
could not avoid remarking with what
particular gravity all were drinking,
and many getting drunk. Consolation
had been poured forth in no stinted
tide, for a huge wall of empty vessels
flanked the entrance. The proprietor
of this house of call for the
thirsty, was a ruddy carroty-headed
rustic, who had contrived to draw
down his cheeks for the occasion, in a
manner unusually solemn. He sat
apart busied, or apparently busied,
with that chief of all sage books, the
Young Man's Best Companion; while
his daughter, as active a girl as ever
chalked a score to a thirsty man,
managed the business. But his mind
had wandered into a long and studious
calculation of the probable profit in
his fermentations, and the Book,
which was only put there as a decoy
to the godly, was neglected. I contrived
to withdraw it unperceived
from before him, and for this feat I
was rewarded by a grim smile from
a broad bonneted son of Cameron,
and a snuff from a tuphorn with a
silver lid.</p>

<p>On returning to the meeting, the
stars were beginning to glimmer,
amongst the thin mist of the summer
evening, and I could see groupes, already
at some distance, of the spectators
retiring home. Far differently
demeaned themselves the pious remnant.
They crowded round their
preacher's tent after the repose of a
brief intermission, and I left them
enjoying a mysterious lecture on Permission,
Predestination, Free Grace,
The Elect, and Effectual Calling.</p>

<p>I am now, and I say it with sorrow,
far removed from the society of those
exemplary and pious people; and I
heard, I confess, with something of
an old Cameronian spirit and regret,
that a proposition has been made to
remove the meeting house into the
neighbouring town of Dumfries. Of
my old favourites, few I understand
survive, and year after year lessens
the number of those devout men who
regularly passed my father's window
on the Sabbath morn. Mr. Farely
has long since been numbered with
the blessed&mdash;and Jean Robson, a very
singular and devout character, has also
rested from her labour of instructing
the youth of the Cameronians.
She taught the writer of this imperfect
account to read&mdash;the Bible, and
the famed Prophecies of Alexander
Peden. She tore the leaf from the
Bible which said, "James, by the
Grace of God, Defender of the Faith,"
and denounced the name of <em>Sunday</em>
as Popish, or what was worse, Prelatical,
and caused us all to call it the
Sabbath. She died 83 years old.
She used to flog her scholars, and
exclaim,&mdash;"Thou art an evil one&mdash;a
worker of iniquity," while the tawse
and tongue kept time and told sharply.</p>

<p>The Cameronians make few converts&mdash;few
people are fond of inflicting
on themselves willingly the penance
of controversial prayers and interminable
sermons. There is a falling
off in the amount of the flock.&mdash;My
friend, the weaver, became a convert
from conviction. Another of the
converts joined the cause in the decline
of life, not without suspicion of
discontent, because his gifts had been
overlooked by the minister of the
parish kirk, in a recent nomination of
elders. He was fond of argument,
and seemed not unwilling to admit
the potent auxiliaries of sword and
gun on behalf of the cause. On one
occasion, he grew wroth with the
ready wit of a neighbouring peasant,
on the great litigated point of patronage&mdash;and
seizing the readiest weapon
of his wrath, a hazel hoop&mdash;for he was
a cooper&mdash;exclaimed, "Reviler&mdash;retire&mdash;else
I'll make your head saft
with this rung." On another time,
he became exasperated at the irreverent
termination of an epigram on a
tippling blacksmith, which was attributed
to Burns, who then resided
within sight&mdash;at Elisland.</p>

<p>It has lost all its attraction since the
voice of its author is mute, for who
can repeat it as he did&mdash;the pithy preliminary
remarks on the great poet's
morals&mdash;the short Cameronian cough&mdash;the
melodious trail of the tongue&mdash;and
the frequent intrusion of explanatory
notes, which the uninspired
could not always distinguish from the
poem itself, all these things are departed
and passed away, and the verses
sleep as quietly as the dust of the poet.
Two other occasional converts scarcely
deserve notice&mdash;one of them was
saved from thorough conviction by
the well-timed exaltation to a neighbouring
precentorship, and the other
has returned to his seat in the kirk,
since the dark-eyed daughter of an
adjacent Cameronian gave her hand,
and it was a white one, to one of the
chosen who was laird of an acre of
peat-moss&mdash;and I have not heard of
any other damsel of the covenant
having caused him to relapse.</p>

<h2>SHEPHERD'S DOG.</h2>

<p class="center">(From the London Sportsman's Cabinet.)</p>


<p>This dog is the most timid, obedient,
placid, serene and grateful in the
creation. He seems studiously conscious
of the purposes for which he
was formed, and is never so perceptibly
gratified, as when affording the
most incessant proofs of his unsullied
integrity.&mdash;Instinctively prone to industry,
he is alive to the slightest sensation
of his employer, and would rather
double and treble the watch line
of circumspection, than be seen indulging
in a state of neglectful indolence.&mdash;The
breed is propagated and
preserved with the greatest respect
to purity in the northern parts of the
kingdom of England, as well as in the
highlands of Scotland, where, in the
extensive tracts and uncultivated
wilds, their services exceed description.</p>

<p>Constitutionally calm, patient, and
philosophic, the sheep dog seems totally
lost to every appearance of novelty,
and insensible to every attraction
beyond the protection and indefatigable
preservation of the flock
committed to his charge.&mdash;In the
most sequestered and remote spots,
dreary wilds and lofty mountains, almost
inaccessible to man, this dog
becomes an incredible and trusty
substitute; for once initiated in the
ground-work of his office, he soon acquires
a perfect knowledge of the
extent of his walk, as well as every
individual of his flock: and will as
regularly select his own, and disperse
intruders, as the most faithful and attentive
shepherd in existence. This
becomes the more extraordinary to
the contemplative mind, when it is recollected
what immense flocks are
seen to cover the downy hills of Hants
and Wilts, as far as the eye can reach,
without control; and to know that by
a single signal from the shepherd, this
faithful, sagacious animal, replete with
energy, vigilance, and activity, will
make his circle, so as to surround a
flock of hundreds, and bring them
within any compass that may be required.</p>

<p>The sheep dog is so completely
absorbed in what seems to be the sole
business and employment of his life,
that he does not bestow a look, or indulge
a wish, beyond the constant
protection of the trust reposed in him,
and to execute the commands of his
master; which he is always incessantly
anxious to receive, and in fact
is invariably looking for by every solicitous
attention it is possible to conceive.&mdash;Inured
to all weathers, fatigue
and hunger, he is the least voracious
of the species, subsists upon little, and
may be justly considered truly emblematic
of content. Though there
is the appearance of a somniferous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
indolence in the exterior, it is by no
means a constitutional mark of habitual
inability; on the contrary, the
sagacity, fidelity, and comprehensive
penetration of this kind of dog, is equal
to any other, but that there is a
thoughtful or expressive gravity annexed
to this particular race, as if
they were absolutely conscious of their
own utility in business of importance,
and the value of the stock so confidently
committed to their care.</p>

<p>Amidst the infinity of cases so constantly
issuing from the press, in
which proofs almost incredible are
authentically adduced of the courage,
sagacity, fidelity, gratitude, and self-denial
of different kinds of dogs, many
are to be found appertaining to this
particular race; if they are not so
numerous as some other sorts, it may
be fairly attributed to the little proportional
chance they have (from their
remote and sequestered employment)
of displaying those powers in an equal
degree with dogs more engaged in
the bustle of human society.</p>

<p>Dr. Anderson (in his translation
from Dr. Pallas) introduces the following
instance of sagacity in a shepherd's
dog, which he considers truly
astonishing; and it will create no surprise
with those who are in the least
acquainted with their perfections.</p>

<p>"The owner himself having been
hanged some years ago for sheep
stealing, the following fact, among
others, respecting the dog, was authenticated
by evidence upon his trial.
When the man intended to steal any
sheep, he did not do it himself, but
detached his dog to perform the business.
With this view, under pretence
of looking at the sheep with an
intention to purchase them, he went
through the flock with the dog at his
feet, to whom he secretly gave a signal,
so as to let him know the individuals
he wanted, to the number of ten
or twenty, out of a flock of some hundreds;
he then went away, and at a
distance of several miles sent back
the dog by himself in the night time,
who picked out the individual sheep
that had been pointed out to him, separated
them from the flock, and
drove them before him by himself,
till overtaking his master, to whom
he relinquished them."</p>

<p>The shepherd's dog rather shuns
than seems anxious to obtain the caresses
of strangers, of whom he always
appears to be shy and suspicious; it
being remarkable, that when refreshing
upon a journey with the flock, he
seldom reposes but close to the feet
or body of his master; who well
knows if he but deposits his coat or
his wallet, and gives the animal the
accustomed signal; when the sheep
are at pasture, he may absent himself
for hours, and at his return find the
whole as safe and regular as if it had
been under his own inspection. Although
it is already observed, these
dogs afford no evident external proof
of quick conception, or rapid execution
(except in all matters relative to
the flock, to which their every faculty
appertains) yet their sagacity and
fidelity is found equal to every other
branch of the species, when necessarily
brought into useful action.</p>

<p>"In the month of February, 1795,
as Mr. Boulstead's son, of Great Salkeld,
in Cumberland, was attending
the sheep of his father upon Great
Salkeld's common, he had the misfortune
to fall and break his leg.&mdash;He
was then at the distance of three miles
from home, no chance of any person's
coming, in so unfrequented a place,
within call, and evening very fast approaching:
in this dreadful dilemma,
suffering extreme pain from the fracture,
and laying upon the damp ground
at so dreary a season of the year, his
agitated spirit suggested to him the
following expedient: Folding one of
his gloves in his pocket handkerchief,
he fastened it round the neck of the
dog, and rather emphatically ordered
him "home."&mdash;These dogs, trained
so admirably to orders and signals
during their attendance upon the
flock, are well known to be under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
most minute subjection, and to execute
the commands of their masters
with an alacrity scarcely to be conceived.</p>

<p>Perfectly convinced of some inexplicable
disquietude from the situation
in which his master lay, he set
off at a pace, which soon brought him
to the house, where he scratched with
great violence at the door for immediate
admittance. This obtained, the
parents were in the utmost alarm and
consternation at his appearance, but
more particularly when they had examined
the handkerchief and its contents.
Instantly concluding beyond a
doubt, that some accident had befallen
their son, they did not delay a
moment going in search of him; and
the dog, apparently conscious the
principal part of his duty was yet to
be performed, anxiously led the way
and conducted the agitated parents to
the spot where their son lay overwhelmed
with pain, increased by the
awful uncertainty of his situation.&mdash;Happily
this was effected just at the
close of day, when being immediately
removed, and the necessary assistance
procured, he soon recovered, and was
never more pleasingly engaged than
when reciting the sagacity and gratitude
of his faithful follower, who then
became his constant companion."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The instances of intelligence in the
shepherd's dog are recorded in all
books treating of the manners and
habits of the dog tribe. One more
may be mentioned from a recent publication.
It is given for the purpose
of stimulating the American farmer
to possess himself of one of the breed
as soon as possible.&mdash;Speaking of the
"Currack of Kildare," the author
says, "The commonage is stocked
by a prescriptive proportion, attached
to the adjacent farms: every sheep
owner has a particular raddled mark;
the shepherd's dogs are so trained,
that if a sheep, with a strange mark,
comes on his master's front, the dog
will single him out and worry him
off."&mdash;See Statistical Survey of the
County of Kildare, by T. J. Rawson,
Dublin, 1807. p. 121.</p>

<p><i>The new steam ship Robert Fulton.</i>&mdash;This
ship is intended to ply as
a regular packet between New York
and New Orleans. She is said to be,
in every respect, one of the finest vessels
ever built in that city. A communication
in the Gazette gives the
following description of this beautiful
vessel:</p>

<p>"This ship is a splendid piece of
naval architecture&mdash;the most perfect
model I ever beheld, and does great
credit to her builder, Mr. Eckford.
She is upwards of 750 tons, of a very
great length, rigged with lug sails;
has three kelsons, (the centre one
large enough for a ship of the line,)
together with bilge ways, and the
whole secured and bolted in a very
extraordinary manner, perhaps the
most so of any vessel ever built. Her
frame timber and plank are of live
oak, locust, cedar, and southern pine,
copper bolted and coppered.</p>

<p>"She will afford accommodation
for more than 200 persons, is fitted
up with high and airy state rooms,
thoroughly ventilated by means of sky
lights the whole length of the cabin,
which is very extensive. Her after
cabin is neatly arranged for the accommodation
of ladies, and separated
by means of folding doors, in the modern
style. She has also a range of
births fore and aft, together with a
commodious fore cabin. And what
adds to the greatest comfort and security
of all, her engine and other
machinery are completely insulated
and unconnected, as it were, with the
other part of the ship. In the centre,
lengthwise, is a kind of well-hole, or
square trunk, made both fire and water
proof; no possible accident, therefore,
by the bursting of the boiler, can
reach either of the cabins. This trunk
or well-hole being enclosed by very
thick plank, caulked and leaded, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
be inundated with water at pleasure,
without any inconvenience to the passengers.</p>

<p>"The furnace is also completely
surrounded by the continuation of the
boiler, so that no part of the fire can
ever come in contact with the wood.
There is a space of about 9 or 10
inches filled in with materials, non-conductors
of heat, which answer the
double purpose of excluding the heat
from the cabin, and at the same time
deadening the disagreeable noise of
the engine. She is also provided with
a leather hose, similar to those used
by our fire engine companies in this
city, which will enable the hot or cold
water to be conveyed to any part of
the ship, and furnishing at the same
time the great conveniency to the
passengers of a warm or cold bath, at
pleasure. Her engine was constructed
by Mr. Allaire, and is supposed
to be the most powerful and most exact
piece of workmanship ever turned
out in this country; and her boiler is
said to be the largest ever known to
have been made in this or any other
country. Take her all in all, she certainly
presents a spectacle altogether
<em>unique</em>."</p>

<h2>MISCELLANY.</h2>


<p><i>Public Lands.</i>&mdash;The highly important
bill, for changing the mode
of disposing of Public Lands, so
that hereafter they shall be offered
for sale in half quarter sections, the
minimum price to be one dollar and
twenty-five cents, and all to be paid in
cash, has <em>passed both Houses of Congress</em>,
by great majorities, and now
wants only the signature of the President
to become a law.&mdash;This bill is to
take effect from the 1st of June next.</p>

<p>From a late London paper it appears,
that a new and easy method
has lately been discovered, in England,
of preventing the destruction of
the young turnip plants by the fly,
and for which the discoverer was rewarded
with 200 guineas. It is merely
to sow about 2 <i>lbs.</i> of radish seed
on every acre of turnip land, with the
turnip seed; the fly, preferring to feed
on the radish plants, will, in such case,
leave the turnip plants unmolested.</p>

<p>One of the most effectual methods
of preventing the ascent of insects on
fruit trees, in the spring, is to draw a
streak of tar round the body of the
tree; but the surface of this soon becomes
incrusted by the warmth of the
atmosphere, and then the insects are
enabled to pass this barrier. To remedy
this, mix a proportion of oil
with the tar, which will prevent the
hardening of the exterior for a considerable
length of time; and when the
effects of the oil are dissipated, let the
exterior be again softened with oil.&mdash;This
plan is certainly one of the most
efficacious for preventing insects from
ascending the bodies of fruit trees.</p>

<p><i>The scab in sheep.</i>&mdash;The shepherds,
in Spain, cure this disease with an
ointment made of the trunk and roots
of the juniper, by breaking them in
small pieces, and infusing them in
water. The sheep of this country are,
however, but little liable to the scab.</p>

<p>It is a fact well ascertained, that
when apple trees are in bloom, if the
<em>farina</em> be gathered from the blossoms
of a tree bearing sour fruit, and scattered
on those of a tree bearing sweet,
the apples produced from these blossoms
will partake of the flavour of
both trees. In this way the flavour of
fruit may be changed for the better&mdash;a
matter worthy of note, though perhaps
not very profitable in practice.</p>

<p>From Munich, Germany, we learn
that Dr Vogel has announced the
important discovery, that sulphuric
acid, diluted with a certain proportion
of water, and then applied to saw
dust, to old linen, to paper, &amp;c. will
change these substances into gum and
saccharine matter. M. Chaptal, somewhere
in his book on chymistry, has
ventured to offer his opinion, very
modestly however, that even the chemical
art of making gold (the great
secret of the philosopher's stone) will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
yet be discovered&mdash;that chymists will
yet be convinced that all matter is the
same, only different modifications.</p>

<p><i>Calculation of the Period of a Second
Deluge.</i>&mdash;According to the calculations
of the learned astronomer
of Bremen, M. Olbers, after a lapse
of 83,000 years, a comet will approach
to the earth in the same proximity as
the moon; after 4,000,000 years it
will approach to the distance of 7,700
geographical miles, and then, if its
attraction equals that of the earth,
the waters of the ocean will be elevated
13,000 feet, and a deluge will
necessarily ensue! after a lapse of
220,000,000 years, it will clash with
the earth.</p>

<p>During the late inundation of the
Rhine, a hare, dislodged by the water
took refuge in a tree. One of
the boatmen who were traversing the
inundated country, in canoes, to pick
up the sufferers, observed the hare,
steered for the tree, and without making
his boat fast, climbed hastily up
to seize the poor animal. The hare
perceiving his danger, sprang from
the tree into the boat, which was put
in motion by the leap of the hare,
and floated down the stream, leaving
the boatman in his place upon the
tree, in the disagreeable necessity of
watching the rise of the waters.</p>

<p>The Rhetorical Society at Cortryk,
in the Netherlands, has lately offered
a gold, and a silver medal, as a prize
for a poem of 100 lines, and an epitaph
of 12 lines, upon Kotzebue.</p>

<p>From a London paper we have the
following advertisement&mdash;A <em>new
species of man</em>. Among the wonders
of nature none have exceeded this extraordinary
phenomenon&mdash;a man covered
with scales, that rattle at the
touch, is now in exhibition at the public
rooms, 23, Bond Street. Physicians
and natural philosophers will
find an extensive field open for their
inquiries.</p>

<p>By another of a late date it appears,
that in Dublin a <em>steam coach</em> is advertised
to commence running between
that city and Belfast, on the 1st Feb.
and is to run from one city to the
other, and return every day. It is
calculated to run at the rate of about
13 Irish (equal to about 20 English)
miles an hour. It is to carry the mail
between the two cities. It is calculated
that it will be found a safer
mode of conveyance for passengers
than carriages drawn by horses. The
whole weight of the carnage and apparatus
is estimated at about 4 tons.</p>

<p><i>Fires.</i>&mdash;A letter from St. Thomas,
of the 2d March, mentions that the
whole city of Ponce, in Porto Rico,
with the exception of one church,
was destroyed by fire on the 27th of
the preceding month. On the 1st of
January last, a fire broke out at Smyrna,
which consumed 1500 buildings.
On the night of the 2d March, a spacious
hotel in Lexington, (Ken) was
consumed&mdash;loss estimated at 40,000
dollars.</p>

<p>From Pittsburg, it appears that a
part of the vast beds of coal in the
hills surrounding that place, has been
on fire for about 25 years past; that
the fire has, until lately, remained in
a smouldering state, but has at length
got vent, and that during the night it
now exhibits the appearance of flame
like a volcano. It is apprehended
that much of the valuable material of
coal, in the vicinity of that place, will
probably be consumed before the fire
will become extinguished.</p>

<p>At Canton, the imports from the
U. States, for the last season, are
stated at 7,414,000 dollars, in specie,
and 2,693,011 dollars, in merchandize;
exceeding that of the English
Company three or four millions.</p>

<p>Congress have passed a law for
taking another census of the United
States. The enumeration to commence
on the first Monday of August
next, and to be completed in six
months thereafter. Accounts of manufacturing
establishments, and of the
numbers is employed therein, are to be
duly noted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p><i>A Check to Intemperance.</i>&mdash;The
select men in Bedford, (Mass.) have
posted up, at the tavern in the town,
a list of the names of persons notoriously
addicted to drunkenness, and
forbidden the sale of liquor to them,
under penalty of the laws of that state
against intemperate drinking.</p>

<p>The steam-boat Swift, rigged as a
brig, is to depart from New York, <em>for
Rio de Janeiro</em>, on the 5th of May&mdash;is
now advertising for freight and passengers.</p>

<p>The grand jury of Putnam county,
(Geo.) lately presented, as a grievance
existing there, (and probably not less
there than in many places elsewhere)
the practice, indulged in by the bar
of villifying, without sufficient cause,
the characters of suitors and witnesses.
They request the aid of the
court in discountenancing insolence
of this kind.</p>

<p>From a late Petersburgh, (Va.) paper,
we have the following account
of part of the remains of the formidable
confederate tribes of Indians,
found in Virginia when Sir Walter
Raleigh first ascended St. James' river,
at the head of which confederacy
was Powhattan, the father of the celebrated
Pocahontas. These remains
are a few of the tribes of the Nottoways,
to which tribe Powhattan belonged,
the Panunkies and a few of
the Mattahonies. Of the Nottoways,
says the account, only 27 now remain,
at the head of which is a woman,
styled their queen, of the name of
Edie Turner, of the age of about 60,
and said to be quite intelligent, though
illiterate. She is comfortably situated
in a cottage, with the necessaries
of life about her, and her share of the
lands, (about 7000 acres, on Nottoway
river,) tolerably well cultivated. The
language of her tribe is only spoken
by her and two others. It is said to
be of Celtic origin, and as harmonious
and expressive as the Erse, Irish,
or Welch.</p>

<p><i>'Benefit of Clergy.'</i>&mdash;Paper was
not made earlier than the fourteenth
century&mdash;and printing in the century
following. The art of reading made
a very slow progress. To encourage
it in England, the capital punishment
of death was remitted if the
criminal could read, which is termed
'Benefit of Clergy.' Yet so small
an edition of the Bible as 600 copies
translated into English in the time of
Henry VIII. was not wholly sold off
in three years.</p>

<p><i>Nugæ Antiquæ.</i>&mdash;Before A. D.
1545, ships of war in England had no
port-holes for guns; they had only a
few cannon placed on the deck.</p>

<p>There is no mention of writing in
the time of Homer. Ciphers, invented
in Hindoostan, were brought into
France from Arabia about the end of
the tenth century.</p>

<p><i>Respiration in Frogs.</i>&mdash;It appears
from a series of curious experiments,
performed by M. Edwards, that frogs,
toads, and lizards, are preserved alive
and in health under water for weeks,
by means of the air contained in the
water, which they abstract, not by the
lungs but by the skin.</p>

<p><i>Chinese Alphabet.</i>&mdash;The Chinese
have 11,000 letters in use, and in maters
of science they employ 60,000,
but their articulate sounds do not exceed
thirty.</p>

<p><i>Method of rendering Glass less
brittle.</i>&mdash;Let the glass vessel be put
into a vessel of cold water, and let
this water be heated boiling hot, and
then allowed to cool slowly of itself,
without taking out the glass. Glasses
treated in this way may, while cold,
be suddenly filled with boiling hot
water without any risk of their cracking.
The gentleman who communicates
the method, says, that he has
often cooled such glasses to the temperature
of 10°, and poured boiling
water in them without experiencing
any inconvenience from the suddenness
of the change. If the glasses
are to be exposed to a higher temperature
than that of boiling water,
boil them in oil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>&mdash;As the following account, together
with the few observations I
have made on the management and
feeding of fowls, may prove acceptable,
and afford some useful hints to
many among the numerous readers
of your entertaining and widely-circulated
miscellany, you will oblige
me by giving them a place in your
work.</p>

<p>I procured two pullets of the black
Spanish kind, which were hatched in
June, 1818, and fed them constantly
myself twice a day, alternating their
food, that is, I gave them corn in the
morning, and in the afternoon boiled
potatoes mixed with <em>fresh</em> bran, but I
never allowed them to take a <em>full
meal</em> of corn. They had a small orchard
to range in, where, in the course
of the day, they occasionally picked
up worms and other insects; and, I
have observed that poultry of all
kinds eagerly seek for animal food
even after they have satiated themselves
with corn: indeed, I conceive
a portion of animal food essentially
requisite to preserve them in a healthy
state.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned pullets began
to lay about the middle of November,
and continued to do so till
within the last ten days, when they
began to moult their feathers, having
produced <em>three hundred and sixty-seven
eggs much larger and finer
than those of the common fowl</em>. Seven
eggs weigh 1 pound avoirdupois,
so that I have been furnished with
the astonishing weight of more than
53 pounds of nutritious and wholesome
food from <em>two hens</em>. They
were never <em>broody</em>, nor shewed a disposition
to sit at any time during the
whole season, and I understand this
property is peculiar to this species
of fowl: it is, however, an advantage
than otherwise, as the common kinds
can incubate their eggs, and foster
their young.</p>

<p><i>Comfortable Discovery.</i>&mdash;"Laugh
and grow fat" was the grand ancient
specific for long life&mdash;"every sigh
and groan drove a nail into our coffins,"
whilst a contrary excitation of
the risible organs drew one out.&mdash;Truly
every generation groweth wiser,
and we may live to witness ocular
proofs that pain is merely an alleviator
of indigestion, and the repudiation
of a limb, under the doctor's saw, a
pleasant and exhilarating morning exercise;
in short, what may we not
expect after reading the following:</p>

<p>A French surgeon has published a
long dissertation on the beneficial influence
of groaning and crying on the
nervous system. He contends that
groaning and crying are the two grand
operations by which nature allays anguish;
and that he has uniformly observed,
that those patients who give
way to their natural feelings, more
speedily recover from accidents and
operations, than those who suppose
that it is unworthy a man to betray
such symptoms of cowardice as either
to groan or to cry. He is always
pleased by the crying and violent
roaring of a patient during the time
he is undergoing a surgical operation,
because he is satisfied that he will
thereby so sooth his nervous system,
as to prevent fever and ensure a favourable
termination.&mdash;From the benefit
hysterical and other nervous
patients derive from crying or groaning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
he supposes that "by these processes
of nature," the superabundant
nervous power is exhausted, and that
the system is in consequence rendered
calm, and even the circulation of
the blood diminished. He relates a
case of a man, who, by means of crying
and bawling, reduced his pulse
from 120 to 60 in the course of two
hours. That some patients often have
a great satisfaction in groaning, and
that hysterical patients often experience
great relief from crying, are
facts which no person will deny.</p>

<p>As to the restless hypochondriacal
subjects, or those who are never happy
but when they are under some
course of medical or dietetic treatment,
the French surgeon assures
them that they cannot do better than
groan all night and cry all day. By
following this rule, and observing an
abstemious diet, a person will effectually
escape disease, and may prolong
life to an incredible extent.</p>

<p><i>Oats 1000 years old.</i>&mdash;In the highest
point of a field, a mile south from
Forfar, Scotland, there was a druids'
place of worship, consisting of a circle
of large stones, with one (the largest)
in the middle. The field was fallowed
last year, and this temple trenched,
from which a very great quantity of
stones were turned up. Nothing particular,
however, appeared, except a
few bones that went to dust. The
field this year was sown with barley,
and this trenched part with the rest:
so far as this trench extended, there
are considerable quantities of oats, of
various kinds, sprung up among the
barley, the seeds of which must have
remained there more than 1000 years.
Without the trenched ground there
is not a head of oats to be seen. Orders
have been given to preserve these
oat plants.</p>

<p><i>Deaf and Dumb Marriage.</i>&mdash;Nov.
20, 1819, a singular marriage was solemnized
at Kirkheaton, near Huddersfield,
between Joshua Barker and
Mary Moorehouse. The man being
deaf and dumb, could not repeat the
necessary forms of the marriage ceremony;
but this difficulty was obviated
in an ingenious manner; as he was
able to read, the book was presented
to him, and he traced the words over
with his finger.</p>

<h2>TO MY WIFE,</h2>

<p class="center"><i>On the Anniversary of her Wedding-day
which was also her Birth-day.</i></p>

<p class="center">BY SAMUEL BISHOP.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thee, Mary, with this ring I wed"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, fourteen years ago, I said.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold another ring!&mdash;"for what?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To wed thee o'er again?"&mdash;Why not?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With that first ring I married youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grace, beauty, innocence, and truth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taste long admir'd, sense long rever'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all my Molly then appear'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If she, by merit since disclos'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prove twice the woman I suppos'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I plead that double merit now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To justify a double vow.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here then to-day, (with faith as sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ardour as intense, as pure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when, amidst the rites divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I took thy troth, and plighted mine,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thee, sweet girl, my second ring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A token and a pledge I bring:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With this I wed, till death us part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy riper virtues to my heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those virtues, which before untried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wife has added to the bride:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those virtues, whose progressive claim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Endearing wedlock's very name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My soul enjoys, my song approves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Conscience' sake, as well as love's.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And why?&mdash;They shew me every hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Honour's high thought, Affection's power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discretion's deed, sound Judgment's sentence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And teach me all things&mdash;but repentance.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h2>THE ICELANDER'S SONG.</h2>

<p class="center">From a MS. Volume of Poems, by Mr. <span class="smcap">G.
Rathbone</span>.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The southern may talk of his meads crown'd with flow'rs,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where the gale, breathing incense, unceasingly flies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He may vaunt the rich hue of his rose-tangled bowers<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or the sapphire and gold of his bright sunny skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it is not a theme that will light up emotion<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In an Icelander's breast; since his pride and his boast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are his hoar-cover'd mountains, that frown on the ocean,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lit up with the ice-blink that girdles the coast.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When the winter of night darkles round him all dreary,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And his snow-bosom'd hills mourn the absence of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a heart void of care, and with limbs seldom weary,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He launches his bark in pursuit of his prey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rough is his bed, and uneasy his pillow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When far off in ocean he rambles from home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blithe scuds his boat, as her prow cleaves the billow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of the gem-spangled brine, with its ridges of foam.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dear is the dawn of the fork'd northern light,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That illumines old Hecla's broad cone with its rays;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dearer its splendour, increasingly bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When the peaks of the ice-bergs appear in the blaze:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brightly it plays on his dart's glossy pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When it flies, steep'd in spray, on the snake's scaly crest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bury its point in the whale's finny hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or flesh its curv'd barb in the sea-lion's chest.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dear is the summer of day, when the fountains,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Unfetter'd and free, pour the bright crystal stream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear is the cataract's leap in the mountains,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When sparkling at night in the moon's silver beam;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear are the shoals where the sea-horse is bounding,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With his icicled mane and his eyeballs of fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But dearer than all, is the comfort surrounding<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The wife of his choice, and the hearth of his sire.<br /></span>
